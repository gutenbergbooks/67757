ROSAMOND VENNING.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Miss Venning</span>,</p>

<p>Will you, when you read this little book of mine,
find fault with my unmeasured Hibernian enthusiasms
and antipathies, and quote your favourite Greek advice&mdash;&#956;&#951;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#7940;&#947;&#945;&#957;?
So that you bring to the reading of it some
surrender of your reserve and a break in that classic
moderation that we poor barbarians do not quite understand&mdash;violently
tinctured as we are by nature&mdash;it will
be a fresh debt added to the life-long debt I gladly owe
destiny for that memorable first meeting in Athena&#8217;s
charming little city.</p>

<p>The thought of it waves memory back into broad sunshine
untravelled by clouds, among sun-stained marble
pillars and rose and mauve tinted hills, girdling purple
waters, and the long silver olive plain of Attica. Do you
remember still our first walk along the cactus-bordered
path to the Acropolis? Was it not of &#8216;Tragic
Comedians&#8217; that we talked?</p>

<p>So now, years after, I offer you in grateful remembrance
this little gathering of ideas you may not wholly
share, but will not wholly reject, through affection for
your friend, to whom so wide a difference would be
nothing less than a real misfortune.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A couple</span> of months ago I was asked to give
a lecture in Paris on a modern English
writer, and I naturally selected my favourite,
the subject of this little book. It was afterwards
suggested to me that the lecture would
bear expansion, a task I the more readily
undertook because I was happy enough to
learn that my humble effort had sent at least
three intellectual foreigners to the fountainhead
to study for themselves the novels of
Mr. Meredith, curious to see if I had not
overrated his merits, as is the habit of enthusiastic
disciples, and greatly astonished to
find their expectations disappointed, and my
estimate unexaggerated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>While still engaged upon this work I received
from London Mr. Le Gallienne&#8217;s book,
&#8216;George Meredith,&#8217; and not having by me
copies of &#8216;Modern Love&#8217; or the other poems
of Mr. Meredith, I availed myself of his
quotations of the famous sonnet and &#8216;A
Meeting.&#8217; I have also taken from Mr.
Lane&#8217;s Bibliography, added to Mr. Le
Gallienne&#8217;s book, the dates of the appearance
of each of the novels, as my own copies all
belong to the recent uniform editions published
by Messrs. Chapman and Hall.</p>

<small>THE GRADUAL RECOGNITION OF GEORGE
MEREDITH AS A NOVELIST.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is our habit to class under the name of
light literature all fiction, from that of
Richardson to the ephemeral stories of the
latest London favourite, though, as a matter
of fact, even that historic bore, Gibbon, is
not heavier reading than the novels of
Richardson. We accept the term &#8216;light&#8217;
literature in a high sense as well as in a low
one, and to the high class of light writers
belong our old English masters and friends,
Fielding, Scott, and Thackeray. These
writers were purely and simply novelists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
and if they showed themselves to the
thinkers in their just interpretation of the
motives whence actions and complications
arise, and the consequences to which they
lead us, it was hardly because they thought
so much as that they observed exactly, and,
with the exquisite intuition of genius, penetrated
life and its meaning by the road of
sympathy rather than reflection, and unconsciously
gave the colour of philosophy to
their reproduction of observations.</p>

<p>Men of wide sympathies and humorous
observers, which are the two most truthful
qualities of portraiture, they were able to
enter into all, or nearly all, phases of existence,
and under the influence of the personalities
and the scenes they portrayed, give
us what I take to be a false impression&mdash;that
of having deliberately thought out each
one. The falseness of this impression is
proved by the confession of Thackeray and
Dickens, that no one could be more completely
surprised than either by the doings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
and sayings of their various characters. And
this confession is borne out by the mixture
of exuberant spirits and sentiment that
colours all the works of these novelists.
Serious thinkers are neither prone to exhibit
high spirits, like schoolboys let loose among
pens and paper and a reckless abundance of
ink, nor tears of sentiment, like a distraught
heroine recording her melancholy impressions.
Writers of this sort, however great
and universal, are &#8216;light,&#8217; because their
double aim&mdash;for which we cannot be too
grateful&mdash;is to touch us by the tragic or
homely sorrows of existence, or to amuse us
by the absurdities and tricks of our fellows,
and if, by chance, they should happen to
instruct us through the great lessons of life
they unconsciously teach us, it is due to the
simplicity and directness of their genius. And
this is the estimate we English readers will
ever preserve of Thackeray, in spite of the
severe pronouncement against him beyond
the Channel by our more artistic brethren.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
He may preach, as the eminent French
critic, M. Taine, complains; but we are
glad to be so sermonized, and return to
him as to a friend who can never fail us. He
may digress, but we are thankful for such
digressions as his, and feel that we would not
yield his faults for the more acrid greatness
of Balzac.</p>

<p>But this latter half of the nineteenth century
has produced quite a different sort of novelist;
one whose mission is deliberately chosen,
heavily weighed, and unweariedly fulfilled.
Not in the least anxious is he to amuse us,
or rouse soft and pleasurable emotions in us.
The artistic exactions of the dilettanti are
unregarded by him, and his voice carries
far other than the note of caressing persuasion
in it. He does not court our suffrage,
rather does he seek to break and bend us
before the sweeping storm of thought, and
carry us through new paths into a world
where no word is idle, no action or instinct
without its most serious consequences; heedless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
of the fact that we may entangle ourselves
inextricably in the briars and brambles
of a strange phraseology, indifferent to what
may be our mental suffering in endeavouring
to follow him, and decipher his oddly-clothed
meaning.</p>

<p>This kind of writer is a thinker first and a
novelist afterwards, and not a thinker only,
but a scientific psychologist. The novel is to
him the sum of his mental labour, as the
system is that of the metaphysician. The
simple art of the first story-teller, Homer, and
of Scott, no less differs from his method than
from Kant&#8217;s &#8216;Kritik.&#8217; His appearance, taking
into account the materials of which his peculiar
genius is composed, and the bewildering use
he makes of them, is rare; and if, happily,
he should obtain a hearing, after long strife
with the general stupidity of the blockheads
and patient endurance of the bites and barks
of literary puppydom at his heels, he is sure
to create a revolution in the world which
subsists on amusement and distraction by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
this new way of popularizing philosophy
through fiction and the rose-lights of imagination.
His chance, of course, very much
depends upon diction, and this explains to
us George Eliot&#8217;s immediate recognition.
As the first of the modern analytical novelists
in England, she had the good fortune to start
by a simple and facile style, within reach of
the least intellectual reader. Hence, those
who did not want to be compelled to think,
could, without twist or turning, without
racking their brains, or grasping a distracted
head in their palms, follow her story even
when they ignored the profound mental consciousness
from which it sprang. But picture
the catastrophe, the wide convulsion and
fright her first appearance as the author of
&#8216;Daniel Deronda&#8217; would have created! She
would have had to wait, at least, as long for
recognition and admiration as her great and
inadequately appreciated successor.</p>

<p>Remote from her in point of style, though
still of her school, by reason of severe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
thought worked to a conclusion, oftener than
hers an unanswerable interrogation, is the only
living master in English literature&mdash;George
Meredith. He stands beside her and
Tolstoi in the rank of serious intellectual
workers, though we may doubt if foreign
nations will ever reach the glib acquaintance
with his name and the titles of his books
that they are pleased to boast with those of
the Russian master. Mr. Meredith is above
and beyond all a thinker, less simple and
direct, less wholly preoccupied with the
mission of improving humanity and beautifying
life, than either George Eliot or
Tolstoi. Perhaps he has a healthier conviction
that the world is very well as it is,
and that in the main it is all the better that
we are neither so muddy nor so pink as
realists and sentimentalists would have us
believe, but are just comfortably spotted and
well-meaning to escape excess of censure or
admiration.</p>

<p>The British race, we know, has never been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
remarkable for brilliancy, nor, to any special
degree, has it given evidence of perspicacity.
But nowhere has it shown such an inexcusable
and comical consistency of stupidity
as in its slow recognition of Mr. Meredith,
and its blundering acceptance of him when
once a few laudatory reviews have revealed
to it the existence of a prophet in its midst.
We have had among us for more than thirty
years a giant, and a race of pigmies, noted
for nothing but the absence of genius, of
even marked individuality in their stream of
literary production, that flows on continuously
and uneventfully, gape and blink at the odd
sound of his voice, and persist in regarding
him as a grotesque monster. He brings us
the fruits of his colossal intellect in masterpiece
after masterpiece, and because he
applies some hard knocks to our understanding,
never bright and always fearful of the
new, we either turn from him in cold neglect,
or else we grow witty with the wit of
pigmies, at his expense, and accuse him &#8216;of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
breaking his shins over his own wit.&#8217; That
which we do not understand, we decide, with
the superiority of the inane and the ignorant,
to be not worthy the understanding. Used
as we have been to the lucid prose of
Thackeray and the brilliant vulgarity and
homeliness of Dickens, spoiled as our literary
talent has been more recently by the flood of
bloodless fiction poured into the circulating
libraries and fast bringing the monthly
magazines to a deadlock of incompetency
and unimaginative drivel, can we wonder,
though we may deplore, that the taste for
excellence and vigour has diminished?</p>

<p>That his first novel, &#8216;Richard Feverel,&#8217;
should have passed unheeded, in spite of the
remarkable review which the <i>Times</i> gave it
in 1859, is something to wonder at, for surely
such a book might have been expected to
startle the best of his country into superlative
praise, and meet with immediate
popularity. It had already been preceded
by a volume of notable poetry, by that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
extraordinary <i>tour de force</i>, &#8216;The Shaving
of Shagpat,&#8217; and by &#8216;Farina, a Legend of
Cologne.&#8217; Yet these were not sufficient to
convince his fellows that in their presence
stood mighty genius claiming the poor return
it is in our power to make it&mdash;the hospitality
and welcome of our minds. Does such
denseness deserve pity or blame? For
churlishness it cannot be called, as the
neglect shown the great is never deliberate.
Two years were we left to sharpen our wits
upon the pages of &#8216;Richard Feverel,&#8217; and,
mayhap, acquire a taste for qualities utterly
novel to the age and, in a measure, to the
nation&mdash;for something more than English
characteristics go to the forming of a writer
like Mr. Meredith&mdash;and in 1861 we were
asked to make what we could of &#8216;Evan
Harrington.&#8217; The story appeared in <i>Once a
Week</i>, and was illustrated by the late Charles
Keene, under the title of &#8216;Evan Harrington;
or, He Would be a Gentleman.&#8217; Mr.
Stevenson makes doleful mention of a serial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
of Meredith&#8217;s that nearly wrecked a newspaper
financially, and presumably this was
the unlucky experiment, from which it may
be gathered that &#8216;Evan Harrington&#8217; had no
greater success than &#8216;Richard Feverel,&#8217; and
that the hour of recognition had not yet
dawned. Explain it who can. Was there
not a grain of perversity at the bottom of it?
And can there be a more thankless task than
that of labouring against the tide of fatal
dulness, or an unkinder solitude than that of
a man who is a head and a half above the
tallest of his fellows, and can neither lift
them up to his level nor descend to theirs?
There are compensations, certainly, but these
only serve to mitigate the sufferings of intellectual
isolation, and, to the artist, can never
fill adequately the place of generous and
hearty appreciation. Wrapped in his philosophic
cloak, the thinker may make shift to
do without his fellows, and call them by hard
names, but to the artist and the poet, sympathy
and the warm praise of living voices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
is like sunshine to the human frame. But
reliable, if rare, critics had begun to find
him out. In 1862, when his second book
of poetry appeared, &#8216;Modern Love,&#8217; the
<i>Spectator</i> chose to assail, as an unfledged
beginner, the man who had given such work
as his to the world; whereupon Mr. Swinburne,
wrathful, though not invective&mdash;rare
chance!&mdash;wrote a letter that all disciples of
Meredith remember with gratitude. But it
is still hard for us to understand how the
career of any man of letters could be so slow,
and appreciation so long grudged him, as has
been the case with a penman of so pronounced
a type. That he should excite
hostility, being himself of no tender fabric,
is comprehensible and easily explained by the
impatience and sense of irritation that he
often rouses in the breasts of his admirers.
But we can recognise the qualities and
greatness of the writer who provokes our
hostility, and generously give him that which
is his due, while not withholding that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
he excites. Writing of &#8216;Modern Love,&#8217; Mr.
Swinburne, who is certainly upon his own
ground in criticising a brother poet, says,
&#8216;Every section of this great progressive poem
is connected with the other by links of the
finest and most studied workmanship,&#8217; and
that &#8216;a more perfect piece of writing no man
alive has ever turned out&#8217; than the noble
sonnet beginning,</p>

<p class="center">&#8216;We saw the swallows gathering in the skies.&#8217;</p>

<p>Bear in mind this was written by the third
living English poet in the year 1862, of
a comparatively unknown poet, while yet
Browning and Tennyson were writing their
best. And then explain how it is that
Meredith the poet is still less known than
Meredith the novelist, and that until very
lately reading people, if asked about George
Meredith, invariably corrected the rash questioner
by the suggestion that he doubtless
meant <i>Owen</i> Meredith. With Owen Meredith
they were familiar enough, but George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Meredith? They would shake their heads
and tell you that they never heard of him,
or if, perchance, they had, invariably added
the rumour that they had also heard: &#8216;A
perfectly unreadable writer, I believe, whom
nobody&mdash;possibly not even himself&mdash;understands,
and very few try to understand.&#8217;</p>

<p>Five or six years ago I imagined this incredible
ignorance to be exclusive to Dublin,
where we are not very assiduous in the
pursuit of literature, or of anything else but
the fortunes of the political heroes of the
hour. But upon crossing the Channel, and
finding myself in the blessed atmosphere of
literary fervour and progress, I was amazed
to see how few were the literary persons I
met who knew much more of Mr. Meredith
than his name, and even here I was more
than once confronted with the inevitable
Owen Meredith. That the lovers of Mr.
Rider Haggard and John Strange Winter
should not read his works is but the completion
of their intellectual taste; and strange,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
indeed, would it be to see a copy of &#8216;Diana
of the Crossways&#8217; in the hands of these
worthy persons; but that the readers of
Shakespeare and Thackeray and George
Eliot should shun him&mdash;this is where the
incredible and inexplicable eccentricity of
public taste displays itself. And yet in 1862
he had written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8216;We saw the swallows gathering in the sky,</div>
<div class="verse">And in the osier isle we heard their noise.</div>
<div class="verse">We had not to look back on summer joys,</div>
<div class="verse">Or forward to a summer of bright dye.</div>
<div class="verse">But in the largeness of the evening earth</div>
<div class="verse">Our spirits grew as we went side by side.</div>
<div class="verse">The hour became her husband and my bride.</div>
<div class="verse">Love that had robb&#8217;d us so, thus bless&#8217;d our dearth!</div>
<div class="verse">The pilgrims of the year wax&#8217;d very loud</div>
<div class="verse">In multitudinous chatterings, as the flood</div>
<div class="verse">Full brown came from the west, and, like pale blood</div>
<div class="verse">Expanded to the upper crimson cloud.</div>
<div class="verse">Love that had robb&#8217;d us of immortal things,</div>
<div class="verse">This little moment mercifully gave,</div>
<div class="verse">And still I see across the twilight wave</div>
<div class="verse">The swan sail with her young beneath her wings.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>It may be argued that the long delay in
the acknowledgment of his sovereignty is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
due to himself, to his obscurities, his ruggedness,
his enormous intellectual difficulties
offered the reader, like five-barred gates, to
leap, and, in the event of failure, fall against,
stunned and aching all over from the force
of big mental bruises. But Browning is
fifty times more obscure, more rugged, more
difficult. It is true, Browning&#8217;s apotheosis,
in somewhat ironical form, lies in a Browning
Society that, perhaps, may achieve a glossary
and a full compilation of notes. Whereas,
all the poet asks us to bring to him is a
little thought and some brains. As Browning
has his lucid and melodious words, when
the simplest may understand him upon a first
reading, so has Mr. Meredith&mdash;a fact that
does not seem to have served him to such
popularity as Browning enjoyed. Can anything
be sweeter, softer, more musical than
this little poem &#8216;The Meeting&#8217;?&mdash;</p>

<p>And still are we confronted with the
mystery of such a poet&#8217;s unpopularity. Explain
it by the unattractiveness of his difficulties,
and what have you to say against
the soothing charm and the exquisite simplicity
of such lines as these, that linger
in the memory, not only because of their
delicate music, but because of their vividness
of picture and the autumn sadness that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
lies upon it. In workmanship the poem is
equal to the best of its sort, and Heine, in
his matchless songs, has never touched us
with a pathos more searching from its unpretentiousness.</p>

<p>Two years after the appearance of &#8216;Modern
Love,&#8217; &#8216;Emilia in England&#8217; was published,
and in the same year M. E. D. Forgues
translated an adaptation of it for the <i>Revue
des Deux Mondes</i>, under the title of &#8216;Sandra
Belloni, Roman de la Vie Anglaise.&#8217; This
looks like progress in public opinion. At
least, it may be thought, after thirteen years
of neglected labour in strife with feeble and
vitiated taste, the author of so much brilliant
work is upon the point of enthusiastic recognition.
Not so at all. &#8216;Emilia&#8217; created
as little sensation as &#8216;Richard,&#8217; and we may
believe that the subscribers to the circulating
libraries were as little fluttered by the production
of the one as they had been by that
of the other&mdash;being equally unaware of the
existence of either. The book was not extensively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
reviewed, and only the happy few
congratulated themselves upon the acquisition.
Perhaps their satisfaction in it was
increased by the fact that it was not shared
by the crowd, for though the lovers of an unappreciated
novelist may ardently desire to
bestrew their paths with converts, it is not
unusual in them to cover themselves in a
sort of fierce and holy pride with a bit of his
cloak of isolation. If he is miserably misunderstood,
do not they share to some extent
his misfortunes? And is there not a very
decided superiority&mdash;sad, if you will, for
none but the churlish and carping few desire
to keep salvation and paradise exclusively
for themselves&mdash;in the fact of their mutual
want of appreciation?</p>

<p>&#8216;Rhoda Fleming&#8217; appeared in 1865, and
this book seems to have made a more decided
impression, though the writer still
remained in the background among well-known
men of letters, and his name, like his
presence, was on the whole ignored. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
published by Messrs. Tinsley, in itself an
instructive lesson in the author&#8217;s popularity.
But there can be no doubt that the tide was
changing, slowly, it is true&mdash;indeed, imperceptibly.
In 1867 &#8216;Vittoria&#8217; first came out
in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, a review henceforth
devoted to the fiction of Mr. Meredith,
and to which he seems to have contributed a
good many reviews and short poems. After
this, in 1871, we meet him in <i>Cornhill</i> recording
the brilliant and ever-delightful
adventures of &#8216;Harry Richmond,&#8217; and this,
coupled with the fact that Mr. George Du
Maurier illustrated the story, and that it ran
through two editions in the same year, gives
us breathing-space in our long vent of
indignation. We may now conclude that a
portion, at least, of the British public had
awaked, and were capable of relishing such
entrancing novels as &#8216;Richard Feverel,&#8217;
&#8216;Sandra Belloni&#8217; and &#8216;Harry Richmond,&#8217; in
which we hardly read so much as we drink
in life, vividly, eagerly&mdash;life with all its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
sharp, sweet thrills and poignant aversions,
its breathless alternation of mood and swift
race of the passions.</p>

<p>&#8216;Beauchamp&#8217;s Career&#8217; followed in 1876,
first in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, between
1874 and 1876, and afterwards in Messrs.
Chapman and Hall&#8217;s collected editions of
1886 and 1889. Although Mr. Meredith&#8217;s
career cannot be said to have been crowned
with anything like a wide acknowledgment,
or even anything approaching a fair reward,
until he wrote &#8216;Diana of the Crossways&#8217; in
1885, which brought him his first taste of
substantial and general success, and cast a
retrospective glamour upon its predecessors,
people from the date of &#8216;Harry Richmond&#8217;
began to know that there was a novelist
named George Meredith who was not <i>Owen
Meredith</i>.</p>

<p>Considering all that the writer has had to
contend with in the way of block-headedness,
this is most certainly a step in advance.
But to his own especial minority, it is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
&#8216;Diana,&#8217; with all its charm and its perilous
brilliancy, that crowns Mr. Meredith&#8217;s career,
but that unique masterpiece, &#8216;The Egoist,&#8217;
which was published in 1879. Here was a
memorable triumph of art, at which we have
not yet ceased to wonder, and which we hold
apart from all other books that we have read.
After it he may write &#8216;Tragic Comedians,&#8217;
&#8216;Diana of the Crossways,&#8217; and volumes of
poems. Anything he writes we are prepared
to welcome with cordial delight and gratitude,
but we do not expect another Sir Willoughby
Patterne. We are satisfied with the impossibility
of the repetition of such an
achievement. It is not given to many
artists to produce one flawless work, and to
expect a second from even such a mighty
one as this would be to prove one&#8217;s self
insatiable.</p>

<p>From this time forward, reviews, articles,
criticisms&mdash;hostile, humorous, and eulogistic&mdash;begin
to abound; and by the time of
&#8216;Diana&#8217;s&#8217; appearance, the British public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
has been made ready to receive the intelligence
that a master is in their midst&mdash;a
living, breathing master, such as Tennyson
and Browning, and from whom work may
happily still be expected. What effect this
announcement may have had upon the
British public cannot be perfectly defined.
Being unenthusiastic, except in the matter
of low and familiar literature, it is to be
feared that such news has but moderately
moved it, and in the matter of taste, has not
influenced it at all. This new master is
unfamiliar to them in his speech and in his
ideas. He does not dwell upon sordid scenes
with visible pleasure; he claims them with
a voice that is not of their common tongue,
and faces them without the old-fashioned
twinkle of the grave jester&#8217;s glance. If he
caricatures humanity, it is not as Dickens
caricatures it, to tickle us into inextinguishable
laughter, nor yet as Thackeray does,
in a vein of comic satire. If he calls
upon us to recognise that life is often a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
sad blunder, and to pity the blunderers, he
is neither sentimental in his claim, nor consciously
pathetic. He indulges neither in
the mawkish sentiment of Dickens, nor in
the sentimental tenderness of Thackeray,
and as little courts our tears as our laughter.
Brain is what he asks of us, and its use
in reading him.</p>

<small>MEREDITH&#8217;S STYLE AND INFLUENCE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> succeed in qualifying a style so varied
and so strange as Mr. Meredith&#8217;s, and composed
of so many diverse elements, would
be difficult even for his peers. Its quality
is at the same time rugged and elusive,
obscure and dazzlingly brilliant, witty and
profound, harsh and most musically tender,
light as a summer cloud, majestic as a
storm. But his great defect is artificiality.
His splendid pages and his matchless
dialogues never lose the obtrusive flavour
of the midnight oil, and we see most of
his characters through a blinding glitter of
limelight. This excessive use of artificial
illumination, while fascinating us and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
compelling our admiration for the writer&#8217;s
extraordinary cleverness, wearies us and irritates
us at times, and we long for the mental
repose of a whiff of commonplace and a page
or two, by way of interlude, of fluent easy
prose that rests the eye and the brain.
There are so many tricks and surprises
bestrewing our path, five-barred gates starting
unexpectedly for us to leap; we are
deliberately plunged neck and heels into so
many swamps, and bowled over all sorts of
rocks and stones, with the oddest sensations
in conflict, that we more than once pay our
debt grudgingly, and, like a peaceable man
knocked down by a bludgeon, are amazed
at the liberty that has been taken with our
understanding. In this exuberant display
of his own powers does Meredith show himself
to be thoroughly English. He is unapproachable
as a wrestler with words and
phrases, and infuses dead speech with the
vitality of blood and muscles. Words with
him are like thoughts&mdash;strong, living, tangible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
to the touch of the soul. They seem to fly,
and mount, and flutter round us, to catch our
breath forcibly, and hold our imagination in
the grasp of blood-warmed fingers. The most
ordinary action of life, described by him in a
line or two, is not a photograph, but a vivid
revelation, a scene stamped not on the vision,
but upon the mind. When he is not playing
queer tricks with us and keeping every
sense insufferably alert, every nerve strained
to catch the meaning that dances tantalizingly
before us, flying hither and thither upon
fantastic figures of speech, until the writer
himself seems drunk with his own juggling,
he is quieting our baffled senses by these
sharp revelations that have no artificial
glamour about them. He ceases to be the
inhuman metaphorist, and becomes our
brother again, and we forget that he ever
terrified us. I open &#8216;Evan Harrington&#8217; at
random, and alight on a paragraph where
each word is vividly set in a perfect whole.
There is no twist or turning here, and as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
see the red harvest-moon and the dark
water and trees, so we seem to touch the
hand of suffering youth:</p>

<p>&#8216;Over a length of the stream the red,
round harvest-moon was rising, and the
weakened youth was this evening at the
mercy of the charm that encircled him. The
water curved, and dimpled, and flowed flat,
and the whole body of it rushed into the
spaces of sad splendour. The clustered trees
stood like temples of darkness; their shadows
lengthened supernaturally; and a pale gloom
crept between them on the sward. He had
been thinking some time that Rose would
knock at his door and give him her voice, at
least; but she did not come; and when he
had gazed out on the stream until his eyes
ached, he felt that he must go and walk by it.
Those little flashes of the hurrying tide spoke
to him of a secret rapture and of a joy-seeking
impulse&mdash;the pouring onward of all the blood
of life into one illumined heart, mournful from
excess of love.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>In none of his books do such passages
abound as in &#8216;Richard Feverel,&#8217; unless, perhaps,
in &#8216;Harry Richmond.&#8217; These two
books, and in a lesser degree &#8216;Sandra Belloni,&#8217;
may best be described as picturesque
and melodious. The writer is less a thinker
than a poet, and sometimes he sings with a
sweetness that troubles our vision and catches
us queerly about the throat.</p>

<p>But viewing him upon the ground of the
simple story-teller, we must admit that this
is a ground either foreign to Mr. Meredith&#8217;s
original genius, or deliberately shunned by
him. The good old fashion, so dear to Scott
and Thackeray, of bringing everything to a
definite conclusion, either for better or worse,
and clearing up all doubts as to the ultimate
career of even their minor characters, is a
fashion that he, with some cruelty and much
contempt for the ordinary reader, utterly discards.
He cares not a jot for our sympathy,
still less for our judgment. He notes that
life is chiefly interrogatory and unsatisfactory&mdash;an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
unfinished drama rarely terminating with
the rightful wedding-bells or the merited
reward; that choice is rarely justified by
results, and that good and evil still remain
vexed questions to be decided, as far as
definite decision is possible, except upon their
broadest issues, by temperament and individuality,
by race and sex and training, as
faith and love are decided. Look at the
end of all his stories, and you will find yourself
confronted with the unanswerable question
which is sure to fix us in the examination
of the lives of each one of us. There is the
fatal tide, we know, but can we dare to say
at what precise turning of the road of life
we missed it?</p>

<p>This is the philosophy that &#8216;Richard
Feverel&#8217; exposes&mdash;conjectural, questioning;
a drawn game between reason and impulse,
between nature and intellect, between a
philosopher&#8217;s system and a young man&#8217;s first
love. Neither win, because, though a mighty
fighter and a Homeric wrestler with words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Meredith is not of the definite school, and
will not pander to his readers&#8217; tastes either
way. Are you for the mismanaged poor
hero, or for the disappointed philosopher,
gazing in the last page upon the system
fondly built upon sand, and laid in ruins by the
first breath of purely human disaster? Mr.
Meredith resolves that your sympathies shall
be balanced, as his own are soundly balanced.
He leaves you with a question upon your
lips, and your childish reproach is chidden by
his silence.</p>

<p>Richard is the strongest and best hero the
writer has drawn, before he fell in love with
the more intricate complexities of woman,
and delighted in her intellectual surprises, her
social difficulties and struggles with iron fate
and masculinity. We part with him as he
rises from a sick-bed, widowed and broken
upon the outset of brilliant manhood, enshadowed
in a tragic gloom, and who is to
explain to us the evolution of middle-age in
this youth of burning hope and rash promise?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Not the creator, certainly. The throes of
commonplace speculation into which he may
thrust the ordinary reader trouble him not,
and he is less merciful to him even than
Tolstoi. He takes us from that strong
Shakespearean scene, in which Richard reads
the diary of Clare Doria Forey, unveiling
her unconscious and reticent love, only fully
measured by her on the threshold of a loveless
marriage, while overhead the candles are
burning in her mortuary chamber, and flickering
lugubriously upon the lips that have
spoken to him from &#8216;behind the hills of
death&#8217;; and without giving us time to clear
our throats of the gathered sensations of pity
and pain, he hurls us into fresh emotions,
equally painful, by the death of Lucy,
Richard&#8217;s young wife. And after that we
learn nothing more of Richard, and are at
liberty to decide for ourselves whether Sir
Austin, the broker system-creator, and Lady
Blandish married, like any other pair of
middle-aged lovers, or preferred to continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
in the less definite and secure path of platonic
sentimentalities&mdash;the one studying the pilgrim&#8217;s
scrip, the other adding to its wisdom.</p>

<p>The fault is perhaps to be laid to our
complex, inquiring, and unrobust age, that
men like Tolstoi and Meredith should both
be incomplete as artists and as thinkers.
Completeness in art belongs to simplicity of
thought and directness of vision, and these
are the attributes of the real story-teller, who
is never diverted from his task by philosophic
conjecture or by psychological problems.
Mr. Meredith&#8217;s incompleteness is
shown in an affectation of oddness and an
artificial glamour that leave the reader with
senses and wits perturbed, anxiously questioning
the gravity of the writer, apprehensive of
being laughed at, and not altogether sure
that he has not been assisting at the marvellous
performance of a juggling metaphorist,
instead of the discoveries and exposition of a
serious philosopher. This artificial glamour
is more sparingly used in &#8216;Richard Feverel&#8217;;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
hence, perhaps, its larger popularity than any
of his other works. But it is hardly, as a
whole, so great as &#8216;The Egoist,&#8217; &#8216;Rhoda
Fleming,&#8217; or &#8216;Diana of the Crossways.&#8217; In
it the quality of tenderness, noticeably absent
in the rest, abounds, and also a lovely freshness
and a visible delight in youth and in
youthful joys. It is a work pre-eminently
human, with all the defects and qualities of
humanity strongly marked. Had it been
written in blood, it could not be redder with
life. Vitality is its captivating charm and
melody its voice. As a work of art, it may
be far from perfect, and we recognise that it
is marred by many impossible situations,
errors of taste and judgment, and a tendency,
in the portrayal of the famous Mrs. Berry, to
gross caricature. Nevertheless, we love it,
faults and all, with that strong personal love
and a wish for frequent dipping at its sources
that it is the unshared privilege of truly great
and original productions to inspire. How
many are the writers we turn to in all moods,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
knowing we shall ever find something new,
something helpful in their familiar pages!
Shakespeare for the English mind and for a
very few foreigners; Montaigne, and perhaps
Moli&egrave;re, for others. Others, again, decide
between Scott, Thackeray, and George Eliot.
Add to this limited sphere a half-dozen of
the world&#8217;s best poets, and the circle of comforters
and permanent friends is formed. In
such choice company may Meredith present
himself with &#8216;Richard Feverel&#8217; in his hand,
and his place will be no mean one in their
midst. Shakespeare himself might offer him
the cordial hand-clasp of brotherhood, and
assure him that since the appearance of
Beatrice and Portia, no such women as
Diana, Emilia, and his German princess had
ever shot upon the dull world from masculine
brains.</p>

<p>In Meredith&#8217;s very faults there is an excess
of strength. It is this superabundance
and an impatience of drivelling sentiment
that lead him so frequently to shock our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
nineteenth-century taste. I think he shocks
us with deliberate aim, deeming our taste
questionable and unrobust, and our fastidiousness
unhealthy. These blows directed against
our temple of false modesty are in no book
fiercer and more astounding than in &#8216;Richard
Feverel,&#8217; and in no other book has he risen
to such supreme heights. Here you have at
its best the matchless splendour and majesty
of his prose, and pages of prolonged beauty.
You have ample scope to realize the vividness
of his interpretation of nature, and the
delight of young love so magically unveiled
by him in those three beautiful chapters on
the opening romance of Richard and Lucy&mdash;&#8216;Ferdinand
and Miranda,&#8217; &#8216;Diversions
played on a Penny Whistle,&#8217; and &#8216;Time-honoured
Treatment of a Dragon by a
Hero.&#8217; Which of these three chapters to
choose it would be difficult to say, for there
is nothing like them in all English literature
for sweetness, melody, and pulse-moving
charm. If I had to pronounce, I should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
disposed to give the preference to the &#8216;Penny
Whistle&#8217; chapter, though, from the fact that
the first meeting between Richard and Lucy
is oftenest quoted, I judge it to be the most
popular.</p>

<p>Match me this exquisite picture in prose
or poetry: &#8216;The sun is coming down to
earth, and the fields and the waters shout to
him golden shouts. He comes, and his
heralds run before him, and touch the leaves
of oaks and planes and beeches lucid green,
and the pine-stems redder gold; leaving
brightest footprints upon thickly-weeded
banks, where the foxgloves&#8217; last upper-bells
incline, and bramble shoots wander amid
moist rich herbage. The plumes of the
woodland are alight; and beyond them, over
the open, &#8217;tis a race with the long-thrown
shadows; a race across the heaths and up
the hills, till, at the farthest bourne of
mounted eastern cloud, the heralds of the
sun lay rosy figures and rest.&#8217;</p>

<p>Or yet again, this other: &#8216;The tide of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
colour has ebbed from the upper sky. In
the west the sea of sunken fire draws back,
and the stars leap forth and tremble, and
retire before the advancing moon, who slips
the silver train of cloud from her shoulders,
and, with her foot upon the pine-tops, surveys
heaven.&#8217;</p>

<p>In these three chapters we have Mr.
Meredith not only at his best, but better than
many of the best poets upon their own
ground. He sings rather than speaks. He
neither wants to astonish nor affright us, but
solely to enchant us. And who can read
him and remain unmoved&mdash;withstand the
spell he casts upon us? Shelley was never
more musical, more thrilling, and never so
strong.</p>

<p>But there is much else in the novels of
this remarkable writer besides music and
poetry, and the soft showery joys and sorrows
of young love. There are the qualities and
deficiencies of his tragic and his mighty side
as a pendant for the grace and charm of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
mood we have seen. Everything in him is
pronounced. He has a taste for strong
lights and shadows, for grotesque asides and
interruptions; is sometimes crude, always
complex, and often incomplete. His coarseness
is akin to the coarseness that shakes us
to amazement in the tragedies and comedies
of Shakespeare, where ribaldry and lovely
delicacy go hand-in-hand; where, swift upon
the most fanciful play of thought and scenes
of pathetic beauty, and images as exquisite as
a Theocritan idyl, come a burst of clownish
mirth and hideous joking.</p>

<p>Shakespearean is the word to describe
Meredith, both in his defects and in his
qualities. In each is he great, with something
of the unapproachable greatness, the
originality, the blood and brains and nerve, of
the Stratford poet, towering over his fellows
to-day as Shakespeare, alive, towered over
his. Human to the heels, a seer and a
psychologist in one, no word is lightly written,
no character lightly drawn. He delights in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
humanity, and almost wickedly revels in its
eccentricities. Hence his tendency to exaggeration.
He seizes a queer character,
such as old Tom Cogglesby, John Raikes, or
Mrs. Berry, and, not content with their
natural oddities, like Dickens, he must steep
them in the colours of his own imagination;
with the result that they come out of the
process caricatures, and we find it exceedingly
hard to divest them of their comic garb, and
trace them back to the elemental, whence
they started on their devious wanderings
through their creator&#8217;s mind. This characteristic,
as M. Taine observes, is peculiarly
English. Since Rabelais&#8217; days the French
writers are too hampered by laws and rules
in art, inalterable, like those of the Medes
and Persians, to dare play such tricks with
reality and human nature as Dickens, Thackeray,
and Meredith, in their jesting moods,
permit themselves. Scott&#8217;s moods had no
such promptings, perhaps because he was a
better story-teller than any of the three, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
found the humour of life quite sufficient without
the aid of exaggeration. But then there
was no satire or hardness in all Scott&#8217;s
nature, and manly tenderness and sympathy
were his predominant traits. He wrote
stories for the pleasure of writing them, not
to belabour or ridicule poor worn humanity,
in which he kept his faith green and unquestioning
as a child&#8217;s.</p>

<p>But, like Dickens, Meredith is a poet, and,
like him, has all a poet&#8217;s extravagances and
excesses. Scott, as a poet, is never excessive,
never exuberant, and always exact.
His strength is employed with a Scotch
perception of its just value, whereas his
Saxon brothers waste theirs with an endless
profusion. Not that I would compare Meredith
with Dickens, except in his tendency to
caricature, which in Dickens is a vice, and in
his poetical excesses. He tortures metaphor
at times, and lacks measure. This is the
complaint French artists bring against their
English brethren. Perhaps their greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
physical strength, added to the Teutonic
strain that flows through their blood from
the early ages, runs to excess in imagination,
and produces a conception of the grotesque
unapprehended by the French.
Certain it is that the latter escape our
violent emotions in literature, and cannot
arrive at an understanding of them. Our
sensibilities, strung to common themes, and
unexcited by lawless love and cerebral complications,
rouse their wonder; and the
mixture of buffoonery and satire in our
great writers incurs their indignation. For
this they say we are not artists, and
ignore the classical limitations of art. And
doubtless they are right. Upon the whole,
our works of art are less artistic than theirs,
and are produced in a lesser quantity, while
our greatest works sin frequently against
every known canon of art.</p>

<p>In shedding a double ray of ridicule upon
his comic characters, Mr. Meredith so envelops
and twists them in metaphor, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
mildly sarcastic, now a joyous shout of
laughter, we cannot tell with or at us, for
we are not in the secret of his comic moods;
and at times so bitingly ironical that we are
puzzled and astray. Fain would we know
whether he feels tenderly towards us at our
worst, or cherishes an inalterable contempt
for us at our best. For, unlike Thackeray,
he is no moralist. Here, at least, is an
English novelist whom M. Taine cannot
accuse of laying down hard and fast rules
for our moral benefit. His two most cynical
characters attract some of our sympathy.
Whereas we are ordered to loathe and condemn
Becky Sharpe, and feel how much her
railing creator despised her, Meredith allows
us to be glad of his Countess&#8217;s acquaintance,
and shows us that a cynical, intriguing
woman, full of vulgar pride and not illegitimate
ambition, may be interesting, and not
unloved by her creator. He invites us to
wonder at her, and not condemn, and though
he may laugh at her weaknesses, and take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
a wicked pleasure in exposing them, he
cannot be said, on the whole, to show her
any harshness. As an adventuress, she is
unsurpassed, and, unlike poor Becky, lives
and dies, we imagine, a fine lady, driven by
ambition to duplicities, but not consciously
mean or dishonest. Though a virtuous
woman, her morals are crooked, and her
sense of honour is the reverse of keen. We
have seen how such a character in Thackeray&#8217;s
hands would develop, and to what
lengths in heartlessness his satire carried
him. Meredith&#8217;s Countess is possible; but
Becky Sharpe is impossible.</p>

<p>The same may be said of his male villains.
Indeed, he has none. There is something
eminently human in the egoism of the wise
youth Adrian Harley. We greet him ever
with a cheerful smile, and for one of his
witty remarks would have no, or only a very
slight, objection to part with our last five-pound
note. Contrast him with Barnes
Newcome, and you have all the difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
between black and gray. All Thackeray&#8217;s
bad people are irredeemably bad, and all his
good people hardly want wings to fit them
for the angelic sphere. It is true, his female
angels do not inspire us with a very ardent
yearning for the joys of Paradise, if they
are to be shared in such extremely insipid
and melancholy society. Eternity with
Amelia and Laura Pendennis and Lady
Castlewood could not be described as a
captivating perspective.</p>

<p>But Mr. Meredith must not be acquitted
of any pronounced sins against reality.
English taste is such, and its restrictions
and exuberances are so little in accordance
with life as it is lived by even those who
paint it falsely, that it is impossible for
the English novelist to escape sins of the
sort. In general, Meredith is sufficiently
just to humanity in its faults and in its
virtues; it is only when its oddities catch
hold of his fancy that he runs riot, and
surpasses nature; only then is he apt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
overdraw his account upon the bank of
credulity.</p>

<p>Take, for example, Mrs. Berry, whom
Mr. Le Gallienne, in a recent interesting
study of Mr. Meredith, describes as a character
that would have been a feather in
Dickens&#8217; cap. Doubtless, but that is not a
compliment to Mr. Meredith, for what might
do honour to Dickens cannot be said to be
worthy of him. Mrs. Berry is witty and
original to an alarming degree. She is a sort
of compromise between Mrs. Quickly and
Juliet&#8217;s nurse; not quite so coarse as either,
perhaps, but more exhaustively garrulous and
obtrusive. In the fifteenth century she might
have been possible and pleasant, but not so
in ours. She is an anachronism that we
resent. The fault may be with us, but the
fact remains, that we could not tolerate a
Mrs. Berry in the flesh. Of such a servant
a man of genius, or one of a humorous turn,
might be glad as a study; but can we
imagine lending a patient ear to her free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
speech, a stately and solemn old English
gentleman, if capable of understanding what
we call humour, only in its highly starched
and faultlessly correct form? A student of
mankind, certainly, after a certain prejudiced
fashion, especially convinced of the inferiority
of woman, as it behoves a poor gentleman
who has suffered grievous wrong at the hands
of a daughter of Eve; but one whose collar
laughter is never likely to wrinkle or crush,
and whose features under no temptation can
relax into anything broader than a grim
stiff smile. Picture this paternal prig and
polished library philosopher being entertained
by Juliet&#8217;s nurse and Falstaff&#8217;s landlady, and
pronouncing both to be excellent women!</p>

<p>A gentleman who loved his Lamb and
relished his Dickens would put up with her
for the sake of her wit and originality, accepting
her as a possible character, which I am
not disposed to do. But no young girl, with
even less of Lucy&#8217;s refinement, could submit
to her gross indelicacy in that scene between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
them in the Isle of Wight. We know how
reticent and shy young girls have become
since Juliet&#8217;s day; still more so young brides
with the most intimate of their sex&mdash;their
mothers and their sisters; how easily affronted
are their susceptibilities by the slightest
trending towards ground that they so
savagely regard as sacred. It is as much as
one&#8217;s life is worth almost to speak to a very
young bride about her married life; above all,
if she be deeply enamoured of her husband,
and for her mother to seek to unveil it would
be a sacrilege. Mr. Meredith, who makes
straight for nature divested of the swaddling
clothes of sentimentality, and prefers her
mud to the sentimentalist&#8217;s spangles and
pink clouds, will perhaps say that the excess
of delicacy to which naturally sensitive and
fastidious womanhood has let itself be trained
is artificial, unhealthy, and absurd. I do not
dispute that a little more of savage candour
would be an improvement to women, and
that excessive delicacy leads them by a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
apparent slope into pruriency. But honesty
and candour, with modesty, are surely better
than either without it, and if, for the sake of
honesty and candour, we show ourselves
willing to dispense with an excessive modesty
for that of naturalness, surely we must lose
one of the nameless, and not the least, charms
of maidenliness! This reproach I make to
Lucy is not only in the case of her tolerance
of Mrs. Berry&#8217;s coarse talk, but in the occupation
it enters her mind to allot her undeclared
lover, Lord Montfalcon. I reproach,
in fact, Mr. Meredith, with the entire creation,
all the more so as she is the only girl
he has drawn upon the old wearisome lines of
masculine taste, of the eternal old-fashioned
ivy-type, commonplace, loving and pretty,
without character or interest apart from her
second in the immortal duet with his breathless
hero. She is charming, as all creatures
lovely to look upon and purely natural must be
charming; but the freshness of youth and the
pleasant daisy-and-buttercup flavour vanished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
with the years and increasing domestic cares,
what would there have remained in her to
interest us and satisfy a soaring nature like
Richard&#8217;s? The affair of the cookery-book
irritates and displeases us as much as it did
her husband in the period of the moon of
bliss, and the only satisfaction we extract
from it is the inimitable wise youth&#8217;s witty
description of it in his letter to Lady Blandish.
Bret Harte&#8217;s speculative vision embraced
a disastrous sequel to the union of
the Judge and Maud Muller of Whittier&#8217;s
poem, and we may be permitted to picture
Lucy twenty years after, with a bunch of
keys at her waist, still studying the cookery-book,
strong in the fabrication of preserves
and home-made medicines, superintending her
children&#8217;s studies, and arching mournful and
uncomprehending brows at the moral and intellectual
vagaries a man like Richard would
be certain to develop. An admirable wife
and mother, but an inadequate study.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that for Mr. Meredith&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
readers there is no half-way house
between uncompromising hostility and discipleship.
You either bend before him as
your master&mdash;imperfect at times, genius
having its limitations as all things else that
are human, but great in his very imperfections&mdash;or
you reject him utterly. How
those who reject him can manage to
reconcile it to their conscience, I am at a loss
to understand. But this proves the texture
and quality of his influence. It is immense or
it is nought. And by this pronounced feeling
he evokes may he be classed as the founder
of a school. He has introduced a new
element into English literature&mdash;a healthy
and purely philosophic realism, which differs
as widely from the realism of Fielding as it
does from that of Zola. To French wit he
brings German profundity of thought, the
whole wrought into a thoroughly Saxon
setting. Vividness of conception, intensity
of vision, and strength of diction&mdash;combine
these qualities, and you have English such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
no other writer has given us. It is beautiful,
with a beauty all its own, and there seems to
be no feat of which it is not capable. He
has ransacked our language until he has
wrought it, through a process of bewildering
originality, into a flexibility, a forcible
simplicity, a majesty and rhythm that, in his
prose, surpass poetry. Never before have
we received such a lesson in the unimagined
resources of language. Never before did we
so understand how written words may be
made to seize us, fell us, captivate us, make
vivid and tangible to our mind every image,
every trick of person, every hue and aspect
of nature. He does not describe or paint:
he simply vitalizes inanimate objects. And
if he had not made us his debtor in any
other way, we must thank him for his great
and perfect disciple, Mr. Robert Louis
Stevenson.</p>

<small>THE NOVELS OF GEORGE MEREDITH: &#8216;RICHARD
FEVEREL&#8217; AND &#8216;RHODA FLEMING.&#8217;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> this little book is written for those who
have the misfortune not to be acquainted
with the novels of Mr. Meredith, I do not
think it will be inadvisable to add to my
essay a slight sketch of each one, hoping
thereby to send readers to the head source.
Those who allow themselves to be persuaded
thereto will have reason to thank me, even
should they be among the common majority,
unable to appreciate to its full value the new
chapter in English literature offered them.</p>

<p>Much mention has been made of &#8216;Richard
Feverel,&#8217; the novel of Mr. Meredith&#8217;s youth,
and, we are told, his own special favourite.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
The plot of this powerful story turns from a
mixture of graceful mirth, delicious wit, and
profound reflection, to tragedy, upon what I
humbly conceive to be an impossible situation.
And this is the sudden separation of
Richard from his young bride. But after
noting the crudities and errors of taste and
judgment, which are frequent enough in the
book, and which never once hide from us
the lambent flame of genius that steadily
burns through the whole, our fear is lest our
desire to praise adequately should drop us
into hyperbole. It is so much easier to
blame than to praise with taste&mdash;above all, to
praise judiciously. Our wits will always
devise fresh methods for a successful use of
the whip of censure, but in admiration it is
less easy to get beyond the exclamatory
period, and the end of simple epithets is soon
reached.</p>

<p>The stamp of a breathless originality lies
upon each character, however minor, and
commingled in their creation is an indescribable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
mixture of weight and delicacy, of solid,
massive strength and finish to a hair&#8217;s
breadth&mdash;the finish of a purely-cut cameo.
Of the wise youth, that delightful cynic,
turning to obesity, and devoted to his
stomach, it would be impossible to say
enough. Every sentence, long and short,
that he utters is a gem of matchless and
irresistible wit. Adrian Harley&#8217;s wit is
unique, and beside him Sheridan himself
must be content with a lower place. If he
breeds a sceptical thought in our breast, it is
the doubt that any man in real life could be
so continuously and unpremeditatedly witty
throughout a reasonably long record of
utterances. Though not purposely a leading
character, he becomes so by force of his own
individuality, and the pronounced part he
plays in the development of Richard&#8217;s career.</p>

<p>The story opens with a description of the
inmates of Raynham Abbey, the seat of Sir
Austin Feverel, the hero&#8217;s father. This
quaint individual is introduced to us as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
anonymous author of a notable book, &#8216;The
Pilgrim&#8217;s Scrip,&#8217; with one aphorism of which
we are startled on the first page: &#8216;I expect
that woman will be the last thing civilized by
man.&#8217; We see at once that we have to deal
with a gentleman who, like Plato and
Schopenhauer, and a long list of intervening
philosophers, holds the amiable sex in scorn.
Here we have &#8216;the imperfect animal&#8217; of the
one and &#8216;the ugly sex&#8217; of the other more
courteously, but not less contemptuously, defined.
There is no pretension to novelty, for
he admits that &#8216;our new thoughts have
thrilled dead bosoms.&#8217;</p>

<p>Reading further, we discover the clue to
his scorn of woman. The poor gentleman
has been wronged upon his hearth, and is a
widower while yet his wife lives. He once
had a wife he loved devotedly, and a friend,
a poet, whom he trusted. The one betrayed
his love and the other his confidence. The
story is not new, but novel indeed is its effect
upon Sir Austin Feverel. Bankrupt in love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
and friendship, he fell upon bitterness. To
keep his heart alive, while presenting a mask
of indifference to intimates and relatives, he
concentrated all his hopes upon his baby boy,
and, for the child&#8217;s ultimate misfortune, resolved
to found a system for his benefit. But
he wishes his paternal tenderness to remain
unsuspected by others, and dismisses the
nurse who caught him sobbing over his son&#8217;s
cradle.</p>

<p>The inmates of Raynham are certainly a
queer collection of specimens: Hippias, once
thought to be the genius of the family, but a
premature victim to strong appetites and a weak
stomach, living in the embraces of dyspepsia,
and engaged in a perpetual contention with
his dinner. Algernon Feverel, whose career
as a gentleman of the Guards lay in his legs,
until it was irrevocably cut short by the loss
of one on a cricket-ground, when he devoted
himself to the direction of his nephew&#8217;s
animal vigour &#8216;with a melancholy vivacity.&#8217;
A venerable lady, known as Great-Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Grantley, who spent the day preparing for
dinner and the night in remembering it.
Mrs. Doria Forey, the baronet&#8217;s eldest sister,
who fixed herself at the Abbey with the
intention of marrying her only daughter,
Clare, to the Hope of Raynham. There are
two other Feverel ladies, known as the
mothers of two remarkable sons, one our
delightful wise youth, Adrian Harley, and
the other, Austin Wentworth, a noble youth,
who had nobly redeemed a common fault in
the lives of young men, by marriage, and
&#8216;was condemned to undergo the world&#8217;s harsh
judgment, not for the fault&mdash;for its atonement.&#8217;
&#8216;Adrian was noted for his sagacity,
which carried the world, but brought him no
friends. His problem for life was to satisfy his
appetites without rashly staking his character.&#8217;
He was polished, luxurious, and happy at the
cost of others, and, while pursuing the maids
of earth, enjoyed a reputation for virtue.
The world declared him moral and wise,
&#8216;and the pleasing converse every way of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
disgraced cousin Austin.&#8217; And we ever greet
him cordially, for all his vices, and the
&#8216;edge to his smile, which cuts much like a
sneer.&#8217;</p>

<p>In this varied domestic circle Richard is
brought up, the victim of a system. He was
carefully kept from the corruption of public
schools, and destined to enter upon manhood
immaculate and perfect. On his fourteenth
birthday we meet him in revolt against the
system, and flying with his serf, Ripton, from
a medical examination proposed by his father,
who understands physical perfection to be
wedded to moral perfection. Ripton tells
him that his sentiments are those of a girl,
whereupon the lads quarrel, as only boys and
other barbarians quarrel, and make it up in
gallant fashion when they hear voices coming
in their search. Their running leads them to
trespass, and brings them into ugly collision
with one Farmer Blaize, who gives them a
taste of the whip, and thus rouses a passion
of indignation in Richard&#8217;s breast. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
threatens to shoot the farmer, and instead
conspires for revenge by arson. Here we
are introduced to a silent and unobtrusive
little maid, Richard&#8217;s cousin Clare, who
passes through the book a maidenly phantom,
only tragically revealed to Richard and to us
by her death and sorrowful little diary. Her
offence with Richard on his birthday for his
neglect of her, and her penetration at night
into his chamber, is the second occasion in
her short life for departing from the curious
negation and reserve of her character. She
drifts with circumstances, guided by her
mother, and holds her tongue. Of her feelings
and sentiments we are in the dark, until
the despair of silence stretches her upon her
deathbed in search of rest. Silent, white,
not understood, she remains for us the most
pathetic figure in the book. Neither she nor
the author choose to court our sympathies
by any of the ordinary sensational methods,
and her cold pride and his reserve are equally
powerful in securing them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Meanwhile, the conspiring Richard, unmindful
of Clare, is exciting profound reflection
in the bosom of the wise youth. &#8216;My
respected chief,&#8217; the latter apostrophizes Sir
Austin, &#8216;combustibles are only the more dangerous
for compression. This boy will be
ravenous for earth when he is let loose, and
very soon make his share of it look as foolish
as yonder game-pie!&#8217; Hearing Sir Austin
make the round of the house at night, he remarks:
&#8216;A monomaniac at large, watching
over sane people in slumber.&#8217;</p>

<p>Sir Austin, marching onward, hears strange
talk, between his son and Master Ripton, of
fire and delay, and violence and vengeance,
when Sir Austin condescends to play the
spy. He discovers that the Hope of
Raynham has embarked in his own vessel
upon the waters of life. A sensation of
infinite pity overcomes the poor baronet,
asking himself what the years will do when
one day has done so much; but he is
consoled by the consciousness of his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
part of Providence to his son. Baited and
worried by his sagacious cousin, who
shrewdly suspects his guilt, Richard takes
refuge in lies. He lies upon a gigantic scale,
to the horror of his father and the amusement
of his cousin. But there is a fine and captivating
manliness in his lies. He is a
perfect boy in all his moods&mdash;an English boy,
barbaric, brave, and pure. Observing him,
Adrian says: &#8216;Boys are like monkeys, the
gravest actors of farcical nonsense that the
world possesses&#8217;&mdash;which philosophizing leads
him to Hamlet and Ophelia. &#8216;She, poor
maid! asks for marriage and smiling babes,
while my lord lover stands questioning the
Infinite and rants to the Impalpable.&#8217; And
when reminded of his responsibilities as
Richard&#8217;s tutor, he replies: &#8216;I take my young
prince as I find him: a Julian or a Caracalla,
a Constantine or a Nero. Then if he will
play the fiddle to a conflagration, he shall
play it well; if he must be a disputatious
apostate, at any rate he shall understand logic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
and men, and have the habit of saying his
prayers.&#8217;</p>

<p>After the arson adventure, the shifts and
lies, the failure of a scheme to help Tom
Bakewell out of prison for his own crime,
confession, and the bitter cup of an apology
to Farmer Blaize, forced upon him by his
father, Richard comes through the first stage
of his ordeal a wiser and a better youth.
There is a solemn reconciliation between him
and the ruffled system-creator; tears, embraces,
and a new aphorism on the part of
Sir Austin: &#8216;Expediency is man&#8217;s wisdom;
doing right is God&#8217;s.&#8217; Reviewing affairs in
an ingenuous letter to his fellow-conspirator,
Richard says of his future divinity:
&#8216;Wherever there&#8217;s mischief, there are girls,
I think. She had the insolence to notice
my face, and ask me not to be unhappy.
I was polite, of course (British-boy fashion),
but I would not look at her.&#8217;</p>

<p>This brings us to the blossoming and
critical season of the system. Behold him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
on the edge of youth, beautiful and strong
in body, guileless and pure. He takes to
blushing, long vigils, and consumes paper&mdash;all
dangerous signs. The father is distressed,
and orders him to burn his poetic
effusions, deciding, since the mention of love
is dangerous at this age, to put everyone
at Raynham on their guard. Servants in
love are dismissed, the others are ordered to
be discreet and avoid kissing. The visits of
a hopeless curate, in love with Mrs. Doria,
are interdicted, and this excellent lady is
ordered to remove her daughter from the
Abbey. In this virtuous solitude Richard
becomes wayward and miserable, rides like
fire about the country, and has discovered the
nothingness of all things. Adrian reports
him as extraordinarily cynical. He startles
Sir Austin in sentimental fooling with Lady
Blandish&#8217;s hand, and finds he has discovered
the secret of life. He discourses pensively
with other stricken males about women&#8217;s
names, and here we come upon the beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
introduction of Lucy, the second of the immortal
duet of Meredith. Who does not
remember that lovely passage beginning?&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Above green, flashing plunges of a weir,
and shaken by the thunder below, lilies,
golden and white, were swaying at anchor
among the reeds.&#8217; This preludes the divine
love-scenes, the sweet romance of boy and
maid, in a setting of fair landscape, described
as no other pen can describe English scenery.
To analyze these chapters, or select any
passages by preference, were as idle as to
attempt to catch a sunray or sketch a flying
cloud. They are written in sunlight to the
music of love. To quote from them would
be to spoil their beauty. As we read, it is
not only on Richard that the gracious glory
of heaven has fallen. We, too, are under
the spell, and, while we read on, remember
all we had thought forgotten and dead in the
fold of forgotten years.</p>

<p>But Lucy is Farmer Blaize&#8217;s niece, and
consequently no match for a baronet&#8217;s son.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Sir Austin has gone up to London in search
of a bride worthy the high gift of his
son&#8217;s untainted youth. His adventures are
inimitably recorded. We delight in his interviews
with Lawyer Thompson, in his unmasking
of that harmless young scamp
Master Ripton, and, above all, in his discovery
of a suitable bride, when a few years
have been added, in the daughter of one
Mrs. Caroline Grandison, a female system-creator,
whom the author presents as less
amiable than her brother-perfecter of
humanity. &#8216;A perfect woman mirrored in
her progeny,&#8217; Adrian describes her, and
admits that he would prefer her to her
progeny. The fates and his father conspire
awhile against Richard, and after separation,
illness and other discomposing events, he
outwits his enemies and runs off with a
bride of his own choice&mdash;Lucy, the rustic
maid.</p>

<p>Up to this point the book is perfect. But
here comes the stumbling-block. Would a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
youth, whose purity and innocence would be
sure to give added strength to his first
sweeping passion, in the middle of an ideal
honeymoon, still bewildered by his bliss,
allow himself, upon such a flimsy pretext as
his father&#8217;s indirectly-conveyed wish, to be
separated from his bride? To be kept for
months in London through the shallowest
subterfuges? Would either of this passionate
pair, seeing with the eyes of instinct that
never errs, submit to this absurd and unreasonable
separation? The Richard we
know would have found a way to balk his
elders and keep his bride by his side, or
he would have seen through the plot, and
would have flown back to her after a week&#8217;s
fretting and fuming in town. This would
mean the loss of a great and tragic scene&mdash;his
last parting with Lucy&mdash;though the probabilities
would not have been outraged. But
Shakespeare himself may incur such a reproach
and be not less great, and a poignant
situation may be reached by the road of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
gross inconsistency and thrill us not the
less.</p>

<p>Having so far assisted at the launching of
youth upon the waters of happiness, we are
invited to assist at something still more
interesting&mdash;Richard&#8217;s undertaking in the
reform of spotted woman, his fall, his repentance,
and his expiation. We are introduced
to many new characters who do not
edify us, but only one of whom is nearly
irredeemably bad&mdash;one satellite of a worthless
but not inhuman peer, the Hon. Peter
Brayder. We have met the famous Berry,
anciently the dismissed nurse, who caught
Sir Austin sobbing, and own to finding her
Dickensonian volubility and humour depressing
in the extreme. We greet her with a
grimace that does duty for a smile, which
broadens into cheerfulness upon her exit.
Much of the society of Mrs. Berry would,
we own, fit us for Bedlam. The book is so
living that it breeds the strong aversions
and preferences of actual existence. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
very air of reality about the woman provokes
an added weariness. We endure her
and listen to her as a living bore, wondering
when and where she will stop, without the
least inclination to skip a line devoted to
her prolonged and disconnected utterances.
The humour of her matrimonial differences
and of the final <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> escapes us, but
we tolerate it as we tolerate the rest of the
infinite trials of life. In feeling that the
book would be better without her, we feel
it just as we feel that our sojourn in a
certain place, where we spent the summer or
winter, would have been the better for the
absence of some other tiresome sojourner,
that is all. We cannot remember the place
without remembering the obnoxious visitor.
So we cannot remember &#8216;Richard Feverel&#8217;
without recalling Mrs. Berry&mdash;an excellent
woman, in the main, and an instrument of
reconciliation between Sir Austin and his
daughter-in-law; devoted, as bores usually
are, and full of all the virtues. Mr. Meredith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
loves her, and for that reason we make shift
to put up with her. But we could wish her
less obtrusive, and, above all, less garrulous
and gross.</p>

<p>Richard&#8217;s experiences in town, illuminated
by the mild lamp of Adrian&#8217;s wit, carry us
along with him. He claims our undivided
sympathies whenever he appears, and we are
not sorry to have him to ourselves without
his bride. Lucy may conquer the wise
youth by the cookery-book, but as we are
not invited to eat of her dinners, we prefer
the unedifying sight of Richard upon the
Thames and dining with guardsmen and
light ladies at Richmond, or escorting his
Sir Julian by way of conversion of that
indecorous lady to the path of virtue. We
like less Lady Judith, the ardent female
Radical who married a decrepit lord to carry
out her principles, and took Richard in hand,
until he succumbed, upon champagne and
song, into the arms of the siren. The
father who had given him to the world an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
immaculate youth was the first instrument of
his fall. He desired him to see what Adrian
calls the &#8216;demi, or damned monde,&#8217; before
entering upon housekeeping&mdash;an amiable
desire on the part of a virtuous old gentleman.</p>

<p>After his fall, Richard awakes to a state of
desperate remorse, and disappears to a
remote part of Germany. He has found his
mother, as well as perversion where he had
intended to convert, had discovered the sad
little secret of his cousin Clare in her death,
and now &#8216;he is trying the German waters,
preparatory to his undertaking the release of
Italy from the subjugation of the Teuton,&#8217;
in company with the sentimental politician,
Lady Judith Felle. When questioned about
him, Adrian says &#8216;he was going to reform
the world&mdash;unfortunately he began with the
feminine side of it. Cupid, proud of Ph&#339;bus
newly slain, or Pluto, wishing to people his
kingdom, put it into the soft head of one of
the guileless, grateful creatures to kiss him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
for his good work. Oh horror! he never
expected that. Conceive the system in the
flesh, and you have our Richard. The
consequence is that this male Peri refuses to
enter his paradise, though the gates are
open for him, the trumpets blow, and the
fair unspotted one awaits him fruitful within.&#8217;
He views his fault as a pure woman would,
and though knowing of Sir Austin&#8217;s reconcilement
to his marriage and his bride,
learning, too, of his paternity, he shrinks
from returning to her as unworthy. The
scene in the German forest, after he learns
the news, is most beautiful, and a worthy
prelude to that grandly tragic last scene
between Richard and Lucy, when, upon
his return, he discovers the plot to ruin his
wife, in which the baleful enchantress proves
the most respectable and honest of the
actors. Richard has challenged her husband,
Lord Montfalcon, and hurries down
to Raynham, where the fatted calf is ready,
as well as numerous open arms, the kisses of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
wife and child. The strength of this parting
scene is awful. We feel the wrench of it,
and the horror, and sorrow itself seems too
full for tears. After it the catastrophe of the
last chapter is smoothly bridged, and the
sadness of Lucy&#8217;s death and Richard&#8217;s rise
from a sick-bed, numbed with grief, is but a
softly-appropriate drop-scene.</p>

<p>As a story, &#8216;Rhoda Fleming&#8217; is, perhaps,
the simplest and strongest work of Mr.
Meredith. Certainly it is the best-told story
from the artistic point of view. Like
&#8216;Richard Feverel,&#8217; it ends tragically, only
here the tragic effects are not concentrated
upon the end. They pervade the entire
book, and the termination is led up to consistently
almost from the beginning, where
we meet the two sisters, with minds and
beauty above their sphere, and see them
silently watched by two young gentlemen.
The foreboding is unanalyzable, but it is a
foreboding, and we apprehend storm and
contention and sombre lights.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Sombre the book is throughout, and we
regard it as almost impertinent to yield to
the occasional pricks of humour that tickle
us into quiet laughter. How can we bear to
laugh at the oddities of mankind, even at the
bidding of such a master, when we see a
sweet and pure girl&#8217;s life going to ruin, and
understand that the very nature of her is
such that there is no return from the wreck,
no after-sunshine to restore the ravages of
storm? Here is no picturesque mingling of
lights and shadows, no lyrical romance, no
melodies of the upper spheres, to imperil the
dark remembrance of the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>.</p>

<p>The very opening is shadowed. At a
village feast, when children danced upon a
mirthful May Day on a green, lapped in the
soft beauty of Kentish landscape, appeared a
young woman, who had left her home with a
spotted name, and who was left in silence
humbly apart. Dahlia Fleming, pitying her,
expresses to her father a wish to speak to
her. The father stoutly forbade her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
when Rhoda, the stronger, defied him, and
went and stood by the poor girl, he punished
her by not speaking to her for a week. And
the girls, reflecting on this, marvelled at the
cruelty of even the kindest men to offending
or repentant women. This is where Mr.
Meredith is so original and so just. It is
impossible to go far on the road of life without
being frequently confronted with the
unrecognised fact that it is men, and not
women, who are hardest and most cruel to
fallen women. It is they in their capacity
of householder who pronounce the verdict
of damnation, as this Kentish farmer did, and
it is soft and innocent women who, like these
country maidens, would fain offer them the
hand of sympathy and sisterhood. Mr.
Meredith never follows the beaten track of
generalities. When he gives us a generality,
it is one of his own discovery, and you may
depend upon finding a very sound truth at
the bottom of it.</p>

<p>One of the drollest and completest of Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Meredith&#8217;s odd characters is the uncle of
these girls, Anthony Hackbut, a mythical
millionaire, understood by the rustic mind to
be vaguely residing in London, and amassing
quantities of gold and genial banknotes.
The family look to him for elevation and
fortune. He passes for a miser because he
refused to advance the farmer one hundred
pounds in times of difficulties, and sowed
ill-will upon the death of the girl&#8217;s mother by
urging as plea his position of great trust in a
wealthy bank that prevented him from assisting
at his sister&#8217;s funeral; nobly offering, in
his opinion, to defray half the funeral expenses.
He referred to funds as worldly
things, and hoped to meet his family in
heaven, &#8216;where brotherly love, as well as
money, was ready made, and not always in
the next street.&#8217; He ended by a hint of
susceptibility to the friendliness of an invitation
to spend a vacation in Kent, and
offered one of his nieces the post of housekeeper,
should she wish to see London, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
make acquaintance with the world. The
seductions were fruit at stalls, oysters and
whelks and winkles, pictures in shops, sights
of muslin and silks, and rides on omnibuses,
with an occasional glimpse of the military
on horseback.</p>

<p>Dahlia is surpassingly fair, and the
question of her departure is submitted to
grave deliberation in an assembly composed
of Farmer Fleming, held between a desire
to secure the miser&#8217;s money and a dread of
London for his daughter; Robert, the sedate
and handsome assistant, in love with the
dark Rhoda; Mrs. Sumfit, the cook, a very
fat and loving woman; and Master Gammon,
an aged foreman, with the cast of eye
of an antediluvian lizard, who remarked
&#8216;that he never had much opinion of London.&#8217;
Policy and Dahlia&#8217;s entreaties prevail, and
the fair girl goes up to the great city forebodingly,
we believe. It is like a division
of souls for the two sisters so devotedly
attached. A lovely miniature is sent down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
to Rhoda in secret, who marvels at its beauty
and at the secrecy. And the next paragraph
brings down to Kent old Anthony
Hackbut. The scene is inimitable. The
queer old fellow, with a disconcerting reserve,
tosses Dahlia off upon a charge of giddiness,
drinks his beer, because he has not paid for
it, propounds an arithmetical problem to
Master Gammon, who retorts &#8216;that he is
paid to work, and not to think,&#8217; and continues
to eat his dumplings to the fret of nerves
of the watchers impatiently waiting for news
of Dahlia. We learn of vestiary elegances
and temper, and of an old man left to take
his tea alone; and, like Rhoda, we understand
the sadness of it and, unlike her,
suspect its meaning. It is the sadder because
of the farmer&#8217;s pride in his handsome
daughters, so greatly superior to their station,
and of a conviction that he will prove a
cruel judge when the hour for mercy comes.
Rhoda goes to London to rejoin her darling,
her one fear lest this sumptuously-attired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
young woman should be ashamed of her
rustic garb. Robert, a very masterful and
extraordinary young farmer, the intimate
friend of a major and a polished English
gentleman, the prize drinker in his own
village and a water-drinker here, a man of
double life and double character, and at the
same time single and truthful in both, has
already sharpened her acute sensibilities for
the penetration of doubt of Dahlia. She is
dropped into a bitter depth of brooding by
the fact that Dahlia is not there to meet her
when she arrives. It is late at night when
Dahlia comes to fetch away her mother&#8217;s
Bible, and finds her sister. The surprise
decides her destiny for that night. She stays
with her sister, and sends away the young
man waiting for her on the pavement
below.</p>

<p>This young man is the son of Sir William
Blancove, in whose bank Anthony is employed
as a clerk. Thus had he met Dahlia,
to her cost. He and his cousin Algernon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
son of the neighbouring squire at Wrexham,
were the youths who stood watching the
girls one May Day feast. Algernon is a
flippant sinner of the well-known school,
generally beset with debts, and not much
troubled with morals. Edward, Dahlia&#8217;s
lover, is of other texture&mdash;of a perilous
superiority, cold-brained, legal, sharp, and
unyouthfully serious. They have a cousin,
Mrs. Margaret Lovell, whose part in the
story it is difficult to define. She does harm,
and sometimes appears to wish to do well.
Fabulously fair, brilliant and proud, she plays
with both young men, and seems to play the
mischief all round. In the first scene between
the youths we are dashed from a
conviction of Edward&#8217;s cynicism by a very
human and sincere cry: &#8216;Virtue, by heaven!
I wish I were entitled to preach it to any
man on earth.&#8217; And yet this cry and the
flush are contradicted by his cold perusal of
Dahlia&#8217;s heart-broken letter explaining why
she sent him away alone. &#8216;The poor child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
threatens to eat no dinner if I don&#8217;t write,&#8217;
he says, and we pity the girl doubly.</p>

<p>After this it is no surprise to find Dahlia
abroad, and writing home letters breathing
frantic worship of the husband she does not
name. Rhoda&#8217;s trusting joy in the news is
pitiful&mdash;more pitiful still her loyal endeavour
to shield her beloved sister when the farmer&#8217;s
wrath explodes over an unsigned announcement
of the marriage. In reply to his cry,
&#8216;Dahlia Blank! Who&#8217;s her husband? Has
he got a name?&#8217; she protests: &#8216;She was
very hurried, father. I have a letter from
her, and I have only &#8220;Dahlia&#8221; written at
the end&mdash;no other name.&#8217; &#8216;And you suspect
no harm of your sister?&#8217; &#8216;Father, how can
I imagine any harm?&#8217; And then the man
in his wretched perplexity appeals to Robert,
to whom he had hoped to marry Dahlia:
&#8216;I&#8217;m shut in a dark room with the candle
blown out. I&#8217;ve a sort of fear you have in
that dilemma, lest you should lay your finger
on edges of sharp knives; and if I think a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
step, if I go thinking a step, and feel my way,
I do cut myself, and I bleed, I do. Robert,
does this look like the letter of a married
woman? I can&#8217;t think for myself. She
ties my hands.&#8217; To please Rhoda Robert
would have lied, and said it did. &#8216;Her
face was like an eager flower straining for
life,&#8217; but all he could reply was, &#8216;She says
she&#8217;s married, and we&#8217;re bound to accept
what she says.&#8217; His answer is remembered
wrathfully by Rhoda.</p>

<p>Hearing that Edward is married to Dahlia,
Mrs. Lovell exclaims, &#8216;Impossible! Edward
has more heart than brains.&#8217; She resolves
not to forsake him in his folly, which means
disaster for Dahlia, and ultimately for him.
A letter from Dahlia in London brings up
Rhoda to her, accompanied by this uncompromising
father. Lugubrious portent, Dahlia
is not visible to them when they call at her
lodgings. Her letter shows that she saw
them from the window. The next chapter
unfolds the mystery. Dahlia is weeping and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
miserable, Edward uncomfortable and protesting.
Like young men who embark
lightly upon such perilous waters, he is irritated
by the discovery that women are
&#8216;pieces of machinery that, for want of proper
oiling, creak, stick, threaten convulsions, and
are tragic and stir us the wrong way.&#8217; By
way of medicine he suggests champagne and
the theatre. To the same theatre Algernon
and Dahlia&#8217;s family have gone, and we may
imagine the sensation of their recognition of
Dahlia in a box where Algernon has joined
his cousin to help the fainting girl. Algernon
only is seen, and is believed to be Dahlia&#8217;s
seducer. There is sorrow and the face of
stricken and humbled pride in the Kentish
farm upon their return. The farmer&#8217;s sole
aim now is to marry his remaining daughter
respectably and forget the sinner. The scene
between Rhoda and Robert, in which she
still implores him to say that he thinks Dahlia
innocent, is unforgettable&mdash;sharp, strong, and
conflicting. He is sorry for Dahlia, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
ready to marry the woman he loves if she
will have him. Rhoda heard him not, &#8216;her
brain was beating at the mystery and misery
wherein Dahlia lay engulphed.&#8217; She will
not marry a man who fancies he has anything
to pardon, and when he lamely protests
that Dahlia has nothing to do with her,
she bursts out: &#8216;We are one, and will be till
we die. I feel my sister&#8217;s hand in mine,
though she&#8217;s away and lost. She&#8217;s my darling
forever and ever. We&#8217;re one.&#8217;</p>

<p>Pushed by admiration and love, Robert
unmasks himself. Some of his phrases have
a Shakesperean ring. He half conquers
the fierce, proud girl by a promise to help
Dahlia. He shows himself still stronger
in his interview with Squire Blancove, when
the farmer calls to accuse Algernon and beg
to have his daughter found; and still more
startlingly when he returns to his birth-place,
and dodges the young men, flinging
written and public insolences at them. Edward,
returned to his natural element, shows a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
mixture of cynicism and lingering conscience
that he only loses in the fiery ordeal awaiting
him, when to his and our surprise he
finds himself in possession of a passionately-stirred
heart. In Robert&#8217;s native village,
where Edward is staying, we meet one
slimy wretch called Sedgett, who is destined
to be the hero of a horrid conspiracy against
Dahlia. Everyone seems to be more or less
mixed up in it&mdash;Robert, Rhoda, and Farmer
Fleming with a sense of duty, Algernon in
idle villainy, Mrs. Lovett through intrigue,
and Edward as a door of escape from his
own responsibilities. Was ever one poor
unhappy girl so beset by friends and foes and
cruel circumstances to drive her to madness?
On the part of her family, strength and
stern tenderness resolve for her greater
misery; on that of Edward, vanity and
cowardice. Abandoned, she falls ill, goes
to a hospital, and comes out a broken flower,
permanently bent by the storm. What
refuge in the eyes of those who unkindly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
desire her good is there for her but marriage&mdash;with
any man whose name she may bear?
As for Edward, in his profound remorse and
repentance, all Kentish faces are turned ruthlessly
against him, against his offer of atonement,
and poor Dahlia&#8217;s cry for his tenderness.
Rhoda is his fiercest and most pitiless
enemy. Dahlia&#8217;s letters to him have been
suppressed by Algernon, who himself has
pleasurable visions of marriage with the
victim&#8217;s sister, and the wild ramping life of
the colonies. The general decision is that
Dahlia shall marry the loathsome yokel
Sedgett, without any thought of the barbarous
sacrifice, worse than death for her.
And the ruffian is to get a thousand pounds
for taking this tarnished jewel&mdash;such is the
morality of the majority. Pass a woman
straight from illegal arms into those of a
husband, and you wash her white. The legal
repetition transforms the position into virtue.</p>

<p>Edward himself, though desirous of the
conclusion, is wounded and astonished by it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Dahlia&#8217;s silence startles him, and he continually
asks for her letters. He cannot help thinking
of her while seeking the distractions of
Paris to forget her. Never for one moment
does he alienate our sympathies completely,
and we understand from the beginning that
he is neither a vulgar sinner nor cynic.
Indeed, it is with a sense of personal satisfaction
that we greet his return to England,
resolved upon a courageous and manly
atonement&mdash;a changed man, unable to get
the thought of his unfortunate victim out of
his head. In that fine interview with his
father we are proud that he has surpassed
our predictions of him, and we wish he
would be left to warm the poor heart he
has chilled to stone.</p>

<p>But Rhoda is there to shield her sister
from what she regards as perfidious tenderness.
Nothing will induce her to believe in
the sincerity of Edward&#8217;s repentance, nor
accept his atonement. The unhappy girl,
between all these ill-advised friends and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
protectors, is forced to an abhorred ceremony,
where at the church door she is submitted
to the indignity of being flung off by the
ruffian who has married her for money. Is
this human retribution? for it is worse even
than God&#8217;s! When later Sedgett comes
down to Kent to claim his scorned wife,
Dahlia, to escape him, drinks poison, and
when Edward comes, showing upon his pallid
face the touch of wasting grief for all the
wringing sorrows brought about by his own
temporary baseness, and Rhoda, melted to
him, calls her sister down to happiness,
Dahlia is found by the side of the bed,
&#8216;inanimate and pale as a sister of death.&#8217;
She is brought back to life, but not to happiness.
Wasted and weak, passion in her was
extinguished, and neither the touch of her
lover&#8217;s hand nor his voice could ever again
thrill her. Robert and Rhoda marry, but
neither Edward nor Dahlia marry. Her
heart was among the ashes, and her last
words to Robert are, &#8216;Help poor girls!&#8217;</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> atmosphere of &#8216;Evan Harrington&#8217; is
neither that of sombre passion nor poignant
pain. It has none of the lyrical outbursts
that thrill us in &#8216;Richard Feverel,&#8217; and we
are spared in it any violent shaking of the
soul. We are allowed to view life more
temperately, and follow the fortunes of the
characters with an undisturbed exercise of
philosophic calm and judgment. A delicious
humour colours it throughout, and we are
back upon the old sea of metaphors that the
writer had nearly drifted from in the simple,
undecorated strength of &#8216;Rhoda Fleming.&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
We are tossed about upon its topmost
sprays, that sometimes drench us and leave
us in wonder whether the author will
suddenly get serious and, to use one of his
own figures, announce that the curtain has
fallen upon this particular part of his performance,
and expect us to cry, &#8216;What an
exciting game it has been!&#8217; Could anything
be more boisterous than the description of
the great Mel, the tailor of Lymport?
There is a Homeric exaggeration about him
that fascinates while it bewilders. Was ever
such a man drawn since the days of mythological
heroes? Great ladies loved him; he
dressed himself up as a footman, and thought
nothing of setting a house on fire for the
privilege of carrying in his arms a titled
beauty. He was the guest and boon fellow
of lords, and he measured them; he was a
tailor, and he kept horses; he had gallant
adventures, was preposterously handsome
and big and glorious; he shook hands with
his customers, and was never known to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
sent in a bill. The writer remarks:
&#8216;Such a personage comes but once in a
generation, and when he goes, men miss the
man as well as their money.&#8217;</p>

<p>We do not make the acquaintance of the
great Mel, but his spirit haunts the scenes of
his turbulent career, and we learn of him
through fabulous reports and a family of
handsome and distinguished daughters, and
one son, Evan. All inherit their father&#8217;s
physical and natural superiority. They pass,
as to the manner born, into the upper sphere,
and comport themselves in that select circle
with dignity and ease. Behind them in the
town of Lymport the tailor&#8217;s shop, with the
name of Harrington upon the door, exists,
carried on by the great man&#8217;s widow as a means
of liquidating his debts. It is the successes
and disturbances, the intrigues and exposure
of this superior family&mdash;born for greatness but
not to it&mdash;that the book records; and never
was genius more untiringly and extravagantly
used than in the combined efforts of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
three lovely ladies and their brother to conceal
the family origin and pass for people of
blood. The partial success that crowns their
efforts is but an inadequate return for such
an expenditure of brain in well-conceived
and audacious contrivances. People born
with a soul above buttons cannot be blamed
for every laudable effort to find their way
into their natural element! Imagine a
single rose-bush bearing flowers of exceptional
beauty in a cabbage-garden, and you
will have the incongruous effect of the
tailor&#8217;s daughter, the Countess de Saldar, in
a middle-class drawing-room. Grand manners
and aristocratic habits were hers, not by
right of breeding or blood, but simply by
right of nature. So we sympathize with her
in all her graceful and unapproachable intriguing
to maintain herself in a society to
which she had won entrance by her own unaided
genius.</p>

<p>Contrast the genial spirit in which the
writer records the adventures and difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
of this splendid charlatan with the spirit in
which Thackeray has painted us his wonderful
Becky Sharpe&mdash;the broad, half-smiling
approval of the more modern satirist, with
the ferocity of hate of his great predecessor.
Not only does Mr. Meredith admire the
woman&#8217;s genius for intrigue, but he brings
sympathy and affection to the task of making
her intelligible to us. So far from seeking
to make her odious to us, as Thackeray deliberately
does in the portrayal of Rebecca,
he leaves it impossible for us to judge her
more harshly than he himself does. Wherever
she is, we know that we cannot be dull,
and we are amused and captivated enough to
be willing to dispense with the chill atmosphere
of perfect morality and candour. He
does not pursue her with a relentless exposure
of her inmost vices. He preaches no
moral after the fashion of the English
novelist, and he takes his intriguing heroine
as he finds her&mdash;an excellent study in which
he delights. She is no vulgar hypocrite, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Becky, under the mask of a fine lady. Born
in the sphere to which she feels she justly
belongs, she would simply have been a great
lady with uncommon diplomatic abilities and
with a genius in the shading and splitting of
social niceties. Forced to play the part of
adventuress, she plays it grandly, and never
shabbily. All her marvellous capacities are
directed to the concealment of the family
shame and to the maintaining of her sisters
and brother in the eminence to which they
have risen. She is a generous schemer, for
her family are included in her enormous ambition.
It is not for herself individually, but
for the family of the Harringtons, for their
united glory and stable position that she so
unweariedly plots and intrigues and lies. The
three daughters of the great tailor have respectively
married a major, a wealthy brewer,
and a Portuguese count. Caroline, the
beauty, is unhappy as the major&#8217;s wife, and
finally reaches the climax in exaltation by
making the conquest of a duke. Evan now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
becomes the hope of the family, and it is on
his fortunes, his efforts to appear a gentleman,
seconded by his sister&#8217;s (the countess&#8217;s)
efforts to penetrate into English aristocratic
society, and secure an heiress for her brother,
that the story runs.</p>

<p>The heiress in whose pursuit Evan is
carried off to Portugal to learn the management
of his mouth, how to dress his shoulders
and to direct his eyes, is Miss Rose Jocelyn,
one of Mr. Meredith&#8217;s brave and loyal girls,
with a sweet spice of naturalness in her
virtues and in her defects, if she can honestly
be said to possess any. In her train we find
Evan returning to England, clad like a
wandering don in sombrero and cloak.
Rose&#8217;s expressed dislike of tradespeople
gives him a hankering to announce himself
as such, which honest intention the countess
resolves to thwart, and is herself thwarted by
Providence in the shape of a brother tailor,
who comes aboard the <i>Jocasta</i> to announce
the great Mel&#8217;s death, and both ruins and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
saves the situation by mention of a shop and
a uniform. Evan&#8217;s experiences on the road
and in the shop are drawn in Mr. Meredith&#8217;s
best style, and we are introduced to one of
his oddities, Tom Cogglesby, and also to the
suffering countess in low society. On his
way up to London Evan is engaged in an
ugly fight in an inn, where he comports himself
as the only gentleman, and those born to
the title as cads&mdash;not an uncommon exchange
of <i>r&ocirc;les</i>. He meets Rose, and instead of
London he, with his guide and protectress,
the incomparable countess, turns to Beckley
Court, the home of Rose&#8217;s parents. Here
the countess has a field worthy her great
talents. To keep her footing firm, to guide
Evan through the briars of a false position,
and help him to win Rose, whom he honestly
loves&mdash;this is no small undertaking with such
combined forces against her. Lady Jocelyn
calls her &#8216;a female euphuist, euphuism in
woman being the popular ideal of a duchess.&#8217;</p>

<p>The pronounced comedian in a book where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
all the characters pertain more or less to
comedy, is Mr. John Raikes. The tricks
that are played on this young man by fortune
and by men are innumerable, and there is
perhaps a flavour of Dickens about him in
the prolonged burlesque he plays. His
burlesque lovers&#8217; quarrels and the countess&#8217;s
intrigues fill the middle of the book,
until Evan breaks his neck in a breakneck
leap.</p>

<p>Here is an opportunity for the countess,
which she uses to some purpose. Unfortunately,
she is felled by a stroke of fate, and
her origin is exposed at a dinner-table with
the duke. The little shadow of tragedy
peeps here in the married misery of Caroline,
the most beautiful of the sisters, and beloved
of the duke. The fortunes of hero and
heroine are fluctuating, and on the whole
better for Evan than might have been expected.
He is known to be a tailor, and
yet the half-engaged lover of a beautiful
heiress, and the guest of her parents. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
true, the widow of the great Mel, bent upon
honesty, imperils the situation, and Evan
completes the work by taking upon himself
one of the countess&#8217;s crimes, is rejected by
Lady Jocelyn, and leaves Beckley Court
under a cloud, only believed in by Juliana,
Rose&#8217;s rival. The fifth act finds him in
London studying tailordom, offered the protection
of Caroline&#8217;s duke. Juliana, the
heiress of Beckley, desperately and vainly in
love with him, dies leaving him Beckley
Court and all her possessions. Here is a
comical reversal of things, and an opportunity
for clearing away all doubts of him by one
sweeping act of generosity. Rose is engaged
to his rival, Laxley, and when her father
hears that Evan renounces the estate, and
exclaims, &#8216;He must have the soul of a
gentleman! There&#8217;s nothing he can expect
in return, you know,&#8217; cuttingly retorts, &#8216;One
would think, papa, you had always been
dealing with tradesmen.&#8217; The end may be
anticipated: marriage for Rose and Evan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
and the consolations of the Church of Rome
for the dear countess.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sandra Belloni&#8217; and &#8216;Harry Richmond&#8217;
are two of Mr. Meredith&#8217;s pictorial and melodious
novels. Pictures and song abound in
them, and breathless vivifying races with
passion. Writers are not uncommonly
enamoured of their heroines, and while none
of his can claim a lack of sympathy and admiration
on Mr. Meredith&#8217;s part, there are
three that stand out as rivals for the post of
his heart&#8217;s beloved. In different ways, all
leading to the one source, like the various
roads to Rome, is he equally the recording
lover of Emilia or Sandra, Clara Middleton
and Diana. These are his trio of perfect
and bewitching women&mdash;not perfect in the
wooden or puppet sense, but perfect with
the lovely perfection of nature steeped, in the
case of two, in the unanalyzable social charm
which he so well knows how to make us feel
and thrill to. Clara is the exquisite maiden
of upper England, who could never be imaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
out of her social surroundings; Diana brings
to breeding an exhilarating dash of rebellious
Irish blood and a purity of body and mind no
less superlative than her younger sister&#8217;s;
and Emilia, unlike both, is all passion and
flame mounting on the swell of song.</p>

<p>It is a long time since I read this entrancing
novel, and here in Paris, where I
write, it is not attainable for reperusal.
Hence many of the names of the characters
have escaped my memory, though I can
recall their personalities and actions vividly.
I am still impressed with the acquaintance
of a wonderful Greek&mdash;a Mr. Pericles, a
wandering millionaire, ready upon hearsay to
traverse Europe in the trail of undiscovered
musical genius. Staying at the country
house of one vulgar wealthy merchant, Mr.
Pole, he unearths something like it in the
voice of Emilia. The Pole family consists
of three of those inimitable, ambitious, and
diplomatic ladies that only Mr. Meredith
hitherto has drawn us. I forget their names.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
There is a brother, Wilfred Pole, a cornet,
one of those limp and flaccid <i>jeunes premiers</i>
novelists and opera-composers are fond of
selecting to sing the sweetest tenor in duet
with the heroines. The hero of the novel,
as of the opera, is usually the heroine&#8217;s foil,
his unworthiness the shade against which
her splendour and strength shine. There
is a dreadful Irish widow, whose name I
certainly remember&mdash;Mrs. Chumps. This
awful creature is, like the Irishman of
English comedy, purely the result of Saxon
imagination dwelling upon our island without
the illumination of personal knowledge of the
race or the country. I have here in Paris
met a Scotchwoman who gravely informed
me that she was gathering materials for an
Irish novel, though she admitted she had
never been in Ireland, and her acquaintance
of Irish people is exclusively confined to
the few specimens of the race she had had
the misfortune to meet with abroad. I shall
be curious to see that novel when it appears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
and fancy she is not the first Britisher to
represent us to posterity upon materials for
observation so slight and so misguiding.
The only sympathy the lady mentioned
appears to bring to her gigantic task is a
partiality for a liquid as peculiar to the lowlands
and highlands of Scotland as to the
mountains and bogs of Ireland. May unlimited
quantities of whisky enlighten her
and enliven us! for she is bitten by a mighty
hatred of the nameless Celt. Under such
circumstances, barring the stimulus of mountain
distillery, the widow Chumps seems to
have been drawn. Her brogue savours more
of the Thames than of the banks of the Suir.
Such an Irish brogue is nowhere to be heard
in Ireland. And there is something curiously
alien to that country in her denseness and
want of sensitiveness, for we know that pride
and sensitiveness are the curses of the race.
She is an old flame of Pole&#8217;s&mdash;&#8216;me Pole&#8217; she
perpetually calls him, to the horror of the
refined daughters and the elegant cornet;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and as Mr. Pole has squandered her money
entrusted to him, he is obliged to endure her
overt tendernesses and force his children to
bow to her. This contest produces several
lively scenes, including the sequel when the
widow finds she is betrayed and cheated and
her Pole a bankrupt. Mr. Pericles adds to
the liveliness, and also one Lady Something,
who is almost in love with Wilfred, and plays
an ugly trick on him and on Emilia by
getting him to declare his passion for her
and his indifference to Emilia within the
latter&#8217;s hearing. The curtain drops on the
degradation of the gallant cornet and the
sorrowful enlightenment of Emilia. There is
also a tragic figure of an organist and impoverished
baronet, who loves one of the
ladies of the Pole establishment, and commits
suicide because she, loving him, must marry
for her family, and several lively social youths
and maidens and matrons, who act chorus,
wittily, epigrammatically, and sprightlily, as
Mr. Meredith&#8217;s chorus ever does. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
there are Italian politics&mdash;a favourite theme
with the writer&mdash;an attractive Welsh brother
and sister, and several unforgettable love-scenes;
notably, one great passionate love-scene
at Wilming Weir by moonlight, worthy
to rank with those matchless chapters in
&#8216;Richard Feverel.&#8217; The lover himself is
weaker and more pitiable than the average
young gentleman elected by the novelist to
pipe fluted sentimentalities to the sweet
thrilling note of the heroine; a man&mdash;or a
make-believe of man, which is by far the
commoner article, for true and real men are
rarer than true and real women, rare as these
be&mdash;who could doubt the delicacy of Sandra&#8217;s
passionate cry, &#8216;My lover!&#8217; and who &#8216;could
pledge himself to eternity, but shrank from
being bound to eleven o&#8217;clock on the morrow
morning.&#8217; Writers are sometimes compunctious
for the abasement to which they
have submitted their heroines, and spare
them the wedding-ring. Sandra does not
marry Wilfred, and we hear of &#8216;the mellowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
depth, the soft human warmth, which marriage
had lent to her voice,&#8217; afterwards in Italy.
I forget whom she married, but I daresay
it was her Welsh lover, the noble Italian
enthusiast, blessed with a noble sister.</p>

<p>&#8216;Harry Richmond&#8217; is truly a delightful
novel, and, next to &#8216;Richard Feverel,&#8217; ought
to be the most popular of George Meredith&#8217;s
books. It is all wild adventure, bubbling,
bursting fun and lyrical outbursts. Impossible
to catch and analyse its charm. It is a
book written to weave a spell about youth
and sober age. Its exuberance is unparalleled;
not the exuberance of Dickens
or Lever, but a quaint and original exuberance
of the metaphysician and the poet taken
suddenly to football and nonsense verses.
He brings a relish quite other than that
of the habitual jester, fetches from his chest
wilder shouts of laughter, flings his ball, and
tosses off his verses with a sincerity and
ardour not known to those to whom such
things are in the ordinary way of life. Or,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
at least, we are at liberty to imagine he
would, for few of us have had the privilege
of observing such a mixture as metaphysician
and poet at play. Who can ever forget the
inimitable and arch-impostor, Harry&#8217;s father,
Richmond Roy&mdash;his captivating personality,
his eccentricities, his feats, and his comet-like
passage across the sky of our imagination?
His life is a splendid comedy, though
occasionally the comic muse drops us into
farce as broad as any to be found in the
early English dramatists. We are not even
allowed to preserve a decorous gravity at the
recital and exposure of his woes and misfortunes.
Moli&egrave;re himself never devised a
broader farce than his <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in the German
prince&#8217;s court and his expulsion therefrom.
And Shakespeare himself, had he written
nineteenth-century prose, could never have
given us a lovelier picture of a little German
princess and her English boy-lover, with all
the proper scenic effects and landscape
beauty. And what, pray, are the rough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
swearing old grandfather and Julia&#8217;s husband
if they be not English to the backbone,
brutally, faithfully English, like Squire
Western and a host of that school? They
are imaged to us pure eighteenth-century&mdash;barbaric,
powerful, big drinkers, and men of
mighty physique, with whom there is no
temporizing upon the domestic hearth nor
elsewhere. This is not comedy, but life.
English, too, are the scenes of Harry&#8217;s boyhood,
his life in the farm and in school,
where he makes the acquaintance of Walter
Heriot, in love with Julia, the schoolmaster&#8217;s
daughter, and his life-long boy-friend; and
afterwards the little wild gipsy girl, whom
Heriot betrays. All these pictures, vivid
and humorous, carry us irresistibly.</p>

<p>Afterwards we touch a new chord when
the religious sea-captain carries off the lads
for the good of their souls, and one fine
morning we find them straying through a
lovely German forest, where they meet the
little German princess&mdash;divinest and most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
witching of serious little maids&mdash;and Harry&#8217;s
father. The story is like real life, too complicated,
varying, and plotless for a brief
summary. Light and air and warm life-blood
quiver and flow through the chapters.
With the writer, we are mounted upon a winged
steed, and carried breathlessly through space.
The characters are too numerous for naming,
and yet all have their distinct and special
parts. If they are minor at all, it is simply as
the constant succession of faces through our
personal experiences are minor&mdash;that is, to us&mdash;but
not, we feel, in the part they individually
play. We understand acutely that
they are not there solely to please their
creator, and do his bidding like puppets.
They are not introduced to teach a moral or
propound a theory, or even consciously to
act as chorus. They are men and women,
rustics, clowns, and society men and women,
who have their distinct tastes, their distinct
utterances, and their distinct capacities. The
epigrammatist is never absent, and we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
always delighted to meet him or her. Of
course, an English commoner, however
wealthy, cannot marry the daughter of an
hereditary prince of Germany, and after many
adventures, heart-sorrows, and joys, the
countless intrigues of his father, a duel with an
Austrian prince (his rival), and the single kiss
of blessedness bestowed on him as upon Herr
Teufelsdroch, poor Harry returns to England
in the pursuance of an equally breezy career,
made up of wind and wave, of storm and
soft English sunshine. His father&#8217;s personality
tops him, and lends the element
of the grotesque to the gravity of his adventures.
We cannot take him seriously
with such a background.</p>

<p>But Mr. Meredith does not wish us to
laugh unrestrainedly, and so he presents us
with a figure of exquisite unblemished pathos
in Harry&#8217;s sweet Aunt Dorothy, a lady we
can never remember without an odd sensation
about the throat. The glamour of
purity that makes no parade of coldness, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
divine unselfishness, of uncomplaining, scarcely-felt
suffering envelopes her like a veil of glory,
through which we rather define than perfectly
see her. She passes through the book
a beautiful ghost of pale womanhood, shedding
beneficent rays upon her path. As
a girl, finding her lover beloved of a weaker
sister, she pleads with him for her, and makes
an altar of her happiness for the younger
one. When the sister dies, after unhappy
wedded experiences, leaving a little boy,
Dorothy is the boy&#8217;s mother and the father&#8217;s
secret benefactor. She never marries, and
all her money is devoted to the anonymous
discharge of the arch-impostor&#8217;s debts, which,
in this spurious offshoot of royalty, we may
imagine were royal enough. The scene in
which this fact is revealed is, for fiction, of
superhuman strength&mdash;not the restrained
sense of modern art, but the battle-axe
strength of medi&aelig;val times. Harry marries
the squire&#8217;s heiress, his cousin Janet, and
deserves repose for the rest of his days.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Mr. Meredith has written one dull book.
&#8216;Beauchamp&#8217;s Career&#8217; would be almost unreadable,
other than patiently read as an
exhaustive political treatise, if it were not for
Mr. Romfrey and the face of Ren&eacute;e, that
brings the soft radiancy of a dream to bear
upon its intolerable dulness. Would not this
charming description make amends for much?</p>

<p>&#8216;A brunette of the fine lineaments of
the good blood of France. She chattered
snatches of Venetian caught from the gondoliers;
she was like a delicate cup of crystal
brimming with the beauty of the place....
Her features had the soft irregularities which
run to rarities of beauty, as the ripple rocks
the light; mouth, eyes, brows, nostrils, and
bloomy cheeks played into one another
liquidly; thought flew, tongue followed, and
the flash of meaning quivered over them like
night-lightning. Or oftener, to speak truth,
tongue flew, thought followed: her age was
but newly seventeen, and she was French.&#8217;</p>

<p>Beauchamp himself is an impossible fellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
too wearisomely in earnest, of a single note,
which he twangs in a monotonous variety of
tones from morning until night. We fancy
at the start, after the ominous prologue, that
we are fronting a humorous adventure when
we find him a sailor lad, addressing his
challenge to the gentlemen of the French
guard. But unhappily we are not shown the
French guardsmen reading his missive, and
the episode falls flat. We feel we have been
deceived, and resent the deception. To
make up for it, we give our sympathies, such
as they are, to the uncle, a mixture of twelfth-century
baron and unintelligible Whig. He
relieves us of the monotony of Beauchamp&#8217;s
lance-breaking with society, and his extraordinary
conduct in his heart affairs. No
sympathy is due to a man who could go
prating politics through drawing-rooms and
missing two such women as Ren&eacute;e and
Cecilia Halkett to fall upon Jenny Denham.
Indeed, there are some chapters in the book
that provoke a sigh in the bosom of the conscientious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
readers for the useful art of skipping.
Noticeably those dealing with that
unmitigated old bore, Dr. Shrapnel, and his
everlasting letters. Mr. Romfrey suggested
that his speechifying nephew should be sent
into his element over in Ireland. But no Irish
speech-maker of the most pronounced stage
in the disease could ever match Beauchamp
by reason of the latter&#8217;s want of humour.
Irish orators off the Parliamentary stage and
the public platform are ready to laugh at
themselves and at each other, whereas
Beauchamp is in deadly earnest from six
o&#8217;clock in the morning until twelve o&#8217;clock
at night. Surely it can have been nothing
else but sheer weariness that forced the
writer to pitch his hero unexpectedly into
the Channel, and bring his career to an
untimely end. Never was catastrophe more
inexplicable, and from the artistic point of
view less justifiable, than Beauchamp&#8217;s death.
We wake as from a prolonged nightmare
with a gasp. Having failed to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
why he was there at all, we fail still less
to comprehend why he is knocked into
eternity in a single last page, and instead
of being touched, we are simply astounded.
Of a truth, the drawback to the book is its
politics incessantly harped upon. The
subject, treated in the high colours of
Dumas, of the plumed and sabred days,
carries a scent of intrigue and romance to
interest us; or the song and chapters of
revolt, conspiracy and revolution have our
hearts for a nod. What should we have
done had we waded through all this truly
English stuff of Whiggery, Toryism and
Radicalism, without the sweet refreshment
of those Venetian days&mdash;the night on the
Adriatic, and the lovely morning at sea
under the Alps? Or canvassing with this
tiresome hero without the society of that
amiable and amusing idiot, Lord Palmet,
whose mind runs to women, and who
murmurs before a virtuous voter in a local
institute, &#8216;Capital place for an appointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
with a woman&#8217;? This is the key of his mind
and his moods, but it is refreshing after the
dance young Mr. Beauchamp has led us,
and promises to lead us, to the end sans
intermission.</p>

<p>He is not returned for Parliament, happily
for the country, and again we are rewarded
for our trials and patient endurance of them
by another glimpse, all too brief, of Ren&eacute;e
in her Norman home at Tourdestelle. This
is a delightful break, but the inconsequence
of Mr. Meredith&#8217;s characters! None of them
seem to know their own mind, neither the
men nor the women. At one moment we
find Beauchamp wanting to run away with
Ren&eacute;e, and Ren&eacute;e holding back. At another
Ren&eacute;e running off to Beauchamp, and Beauchamp
virtuously holding back. Again,
Cecilia awaits his proposal, and he is inexplicably
silent, though pushed to claim
her by inclination, interest and friends; when
he makes up his mind to propose, she is
off to Italy, engaged to a man she does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
love, knowing the man she loves was to
arrive the day of her departure to claim
her. Do some people act in this way out
of such a novel? We are constantly expecting
Beauchamp to wreck society and
create a revolution. Yet at the end his
uncle, the quaint, twelfth-century baron,
says: &#8216;He hasn&#8217;t marched to London with
a couple of hundred thousand men, and he
escapes what Stukely calls his nation&#8217;s scourge,
in the shape of a statue turned out by an
English chisel. No, we haven&#8217;t had much
public excitement out of him. But one thing
he did do: he <i>got me down on my knees</i>.&#8217;
He married Jenny Denham and left a son
behind him. This is all he did besides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> however great and individual &#8216;Richard
Feverel&#8217; and the other novels of George
Meredith may be, and however high a place
some of us may accord them in the collection
of books that, once read, become our daily
companions&mdash;a sort of mental sustenance
upon which we speedily learn to fall back
from sheer force of habit&mdash;not even &#8216;Richard&#8217;
can be described as the most individual of
Meredith&#8217;s works. In it is no hint given
of the peculiar stand this new genius was
to take among modern writers. In it we
were not led to scent the great champion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the mighty swordsman of woman, by his
commonplace Lucy and his silent Clare.
&#8216;Richard Feverel&#8217; was like a sun-burst,
broken with storm and strife, flashed upon
the insipidity of latter-day fiction and exposing
its perishableness. Of such a writer
anything and everything might justly be
expected, but even from him was &#8216;The
Egoist&#8217; a surprise from which we have not
yet had time to recover.</p>

<p>Here this subtle psychologist concerns
himself neither with plot nor passion; neither
with tragedy nor romance, nor with any of
what may be called the passional springs
of action and will. If &#8216;Richard Feverel&#8217;
was an original and bewildering canter along
the highway of fiction, &#8216;The Egoist&#8217; may be
described as a breathless charge into the
unknown, a direct and forcible challenge of
the unsuspected. Here we see mercilessly
unveiled civilized man, as he thinks and
feels, in the person of a handsome young
squire enjoying every advantage of nature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
fortune and birth. Nothing in him courts
rejection of our sympathies. He is not a
villain, and he is a polished, perfect gentleman,
well informed, well mannered, well
groomed, and exceedingly well mounted for
a more than spirited ride through the plains
and over the hills of experience. Such a
man as Sir Willoughby Patterne, of Patterne
Hall, in command of a rent-roll of &pound;20,000,
the ordinary novelist, or even our old friends,
the great Immortals, could only conceive as
playing a successful and a triumphant part
through life. Why, in fact, should punishment
and humiliation of the lightest nature
pursue a youth in whom no vicious taste,
no fixed vice, is pronounced? And who but
a dissector so utterly merciless as Mr. Meredith
could find courage to drive his dissecting-knife
straight to the heart of the
conventional system, and qualify the unrevealed
disease of this graceful ornament of
county society by the ugly name of egoism?
the malady of the Ego? Who else but this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
captain of woman could draw us maidens
bold enough to read the man and reject him,
in spite of the big social bribes he carries in
his hand? Ah, this is Mr. Meredith&#8217;s great
and original note, once he has relieved his
youthful soul of the romance of &#8216;Richard
Feverel.&#8217; Woman is his study, especially
young militant womanhood, and what a
study he has made of her! Upon this
theme not a single male writer, living or
dead, since Shakespeare, can approach him,
and to it he brings modern subtle penetration
added to Shakespeare&#8217;s purely natural instinct.
Not only has he caught the bloom and poetry
of womanhood, and made her visible to us
to the soul&mdash;this were the achievement of the
poet and the artist of very exquisite perceptions;
but he has got at the very root
of her nature&mdash;quite another thing. Women
reading him gasp at his revelations, such as
they would never dare to make or dream,
so completely hedged round are they by the
conventionalities of fiction. When they take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
to writing stories, they either set themselves
limitations in the portrayal of their female
characters stricter than their brothers, or to
hide their own ignorance of themselves (a
mystery for us as much as for men) set off
at a galloping pace into the realms of
improbability.</p>

<p>In all fiction there is not another girl so
enchanting and healthily intelligent as Clara
Middleton&mdash;none described like her. In
addition to the attractions of birth, breeding,
and beauty which the writer thoroughly
relishes, are those of sensibilities that can
be delicate without affectation, a delightful
wit untainted by smartness, singular good
taste and tact, and honesty of soul. Here
is a sparkling young woman as clear as
daylight, as fresh as the morning dew,
beautiful to look upon, as Meredith&#8217;s women
always are, sweet and bewitching without
any shabby tricks of mind or habit, who at
the same time thinks for herself, a rare virtue
in the male novelist&#8217;s heroine. She is all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
warm blood and variable moods, as befits
her age and sex, but never once untrue to
the finest instincts of maidenhood, and unerring
in her judgment. She is not perfect,
her accomplishments are not enumerated, we
never find her playing Beethoven or reading
the stars, and somehow, without one word
having been said upon the subject, we get
the impression that she is a young woman of
intellectual resources, and qualified to pronounce
upon subjects that engage the minds
of sages and artists, while the music of
youth runs blithely through her veins, and
her feet are nimble in a race with a school-boy.
It is her struggle with her lover, the
Egoist, that completes the interest of the
book.</p>

<p>Here we have Mr. Meredith purified,
polished, complete, without any break in the
unity of his work, or any awkward twist in
the even flow of narrative, based solely upon
subtle and most delicate analysis. The
durability of such work is quite as obvious as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
that of the best that has already withstood
the test of centuries, and when to-day&#8217;s
literature comes to be old-fashioned, &#8216;The
Egoist&#8217; will still hold its place as a lasting
monument of psychological diagnosis.</p>

<p>Of the story itself little need be said, as
it hangs upon a single situation unfolded in
one act after a short prologue introducing us
to the chief <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>. And can one
possibly hope to explain how this situation
is worked and twisted and unfolded&mdash;how
illuminated and ransacked to its most hidden
depths for the undiscovered clue of self, for
the unrevealed spring which prompts even
our everyday &#8216;yea&#8217; or &#8216;nay&#8217;? To endeavour
to do so would be to undertake a
task only second to that of the writing of
&#8216;The Egoist.&#8217; Meredith, I should imagine,
would shrink from it. It is simply an
analysis of the Ego. The universal Ego
takes the polished and affable form of a
young English squire, the pink of perfection,
and highly commendable to ladies of fastidious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
tastes, the eye of whose soul is turned ceaselessly
upon self. There he walks and sits
and talks before our newly-illuminated vision,
naked to the soul, each beat of the heart
discovered without its protection of flesh or
garment; not one single young man whom
we meet and part with in fiction, but the
large pervading personality of human existence
crystallized to one permanent shape&mdash;not
Sir Willoughby Patterne, of Patterne
Hall, but the soul of selfishness endowed
with a form that might just as well have been
yours or mine or our next-door neighbour&#8217;s.
This is Meredith&#8217;s most absolute triumph of
art, to which he brought all the resources
of his scientific knowledge of humanity&mdash;his
powerful phraseology and marvellous
metaphor.</p>

<p>Other writers have drawn us pictures
enough of selfish men and selfish women.
They abound in the literature of all races,
selfishness being one of our commonest
defects. But Meredith has given a heart and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
soul and mind to the vice; in fine raiment
and graceful proportions, smiled upon by the
undiscerning, he makes it tread the boards of
our common experience, with the blood and
nerves and muscles of manhood. This is an
achievement of which even a man of such
singular genius as his may be proud. Other
writers are happy when they succeed in
drawing a type&mdash;in immortalizing a single
character; but this one has done something
greater, more unique and more imperishable
still. Into space he enables us to stare,
marvelling, at something hitherto barely
suspected, now a tangible form with familiar
lineaments and unforgettable tones of voice,
a something that we dimly understand
rises up with us and lies down with us, gives
the stamp of meanness to our best endeavours,
and misleads us in our noblest aspirations.
Sir Willoughby is the personality of self that
floats subtly round us and centres all our
thoughts. It takes a masculine shape because
the course of the world, both civilized and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
barbaric, is directed by the wheels of male
selfishness. Feminine selfishness has quite
another direction. It affects the domestic
circle, the persons and interests immediately
within its scope. It may bring added discomfort
to the immediate victims, but it
leaves the world without merrily indifferent,
conscious of superior strength that can always
laugh it down, with a vitality that cannot be
sapped and a confidence in laws that form a
barrier against its encroachments. Not so
male egoism. This makes straight for the
whole race of women, mercilessly potent by
reason of physical force, and backed by all
the laws, written and unwritten, of its own
making.</p>

<p>It is this crushing exposure of the wide-spread
plague, the extension and mingling
of its fibres, the crudity and coarseness of
its very refinement and super-fastidiousness,
that gives &#8216;The Egoist&#8217; a scientific as well
as an artistic value, and commands for it in
English literature a place apart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>As a work of art, it is, indeed, the most
complete and perfect thing that Meredith has
done&mdash;a flawless masterpiece without any
of the writer&#8217;s eccentric deviations and
mannerisms. Perhaps oppressively witty,
though much less so than &#8216;Diana,&#8217; striking
none but the delicately comic chord, and
turning to pathos upon the point of a
smiling curl of the lip, it carries us through
a few weeks&#8217; comedy at a pleasant canter to
the accompaniment of fanciful humour and
polished irony. If we come upon an occasional
odd effect&mdash;a queer simile, a bit of
isolated poetry lapsed into prose, a bar of
pure melody dropped into speech&mdash;we recognise
with pleasure and delight the author
of &#8216;Richard Feverel,&#8217; and we greet him with a
cordial smile. This other writer is new to us,
but not the less welcome&mdash;less serious, more
polished and more fanciful; and while less of
a poet, he is more of an artist&mdash;less philosophic,
he is much more scientific. The play
of wit is less sparkling and more penetrative.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
It shines, a soft luminous light, with undiminished
radiance throughout the book,
lending itself less easily to quotation, baffling
even the memory by the quality of the flying
phrases. Upon all subjects of daily life has
he something original to say, and he can
even be poetical and fresh, and compel our
senses to delighted thrills upon the worn-out
theme of woman&#8217;s dress&mdash;a theme that
wrecks other writers and leaves them dismayed
by the dulness and insipidity of their
own description. Read those lines in &#8216;The
Egoist,&#8217; upon Clara&#8217;s dress in a breeze.</p>

<p>The characters, as I have said, are few.
Clara, the heroine, described by Vernon
Whitford, that scholar and student of equable
temper, as &#8216;a mountain echo&#8217;&mdash;an idea that
still lingers with us when we have closed the
book as the sum of her sweetness, wholesomeness
and natural charm&mdash;and by Mrs.
Mountstuart less felicitously as &#8216;a dainty
rogue in porcelain.&#8217; Here we gather an
added something of her exterior, and <i>look</i> at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
a mountain echo with the eyes of fashion,
just as we see through the same sharp and
unimaginative eyes &#8216;the sunken brilliancy
of the lean long-walker and scholar in a
Ph&#339;bus-Apollo turned fasting friar,&#8217; and the
poetess, L&aelig;titia Dale, upon her vivid stroke,
&#8216;coming with a romantic tale upon her eyelashes.&#8217;
This is one of Meredith&#8217;s tricks&mdash;the
uttering of pointed phrases by the tongues
of sharp, clever women. Sometimes they are
far-fetched; always are they too carefully
trimmed and edged, as hasty phrases have
not often the felicity of being edged. In
general it is the fault of his characters to talk
too brilliantly, and he forgets that men and
women in their commonplace moods are not
habitually metaphorical and literary.</p>

<p>As the essence of self-made man, it may
be thought that Sir Willoughby is meant to
represent an unpleasant and an unusual type.
Not so at all. If it had not been for Meredith,
he might have gone tranquilly down to
the grave, and not even his worst enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
would have had very obvious cause to scent
the wolf within him. We meet him first upon
his majority&mdash;a very fascinating and fastidious
young Englishman whom we gradually understand
is the letter &#8216;I&#8217; vivified and made
human, mentally as well as physically
straightened to its erectness, and as uncompromisingly
personal. We heedlessly learn
of his dallying with L&aelig;titia Dale, of the
silent and unexacting worship of this soft
rhyming representative of &#8216;starving women&#8217;
who endure their hunger uncomplainingly,
and are too proud to offer themselves for the
sensational pity of a world ever in demand of
dramatic situations. We enjoy a secret satisfaction
in his discomfiture when Constantia
Durham leaves him in the lurch and runs off
with the more cheerful military figure, and
yet we still hardly realize what manner of
man he is when he in turn plants L&aelig;titia
and seeks distraction in three years&#8217; travel.
Meredith makes us understand that he is a
youth of spurious niceness, who objected to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
his betrothed talking freely about male
cousins and friends, and considered the pursuit
of competing admirers a stain upon her.
Cloistral purity was his demand in the
market; woman emerging from an eggshell,
&#8216;somewhat more astonished at things than a
chicken ... and seeing him, with her sex&#8217;s
eyes, first of all men.&#8217;</p>

<p>How much we thank Meredith for showing
us the &#8216;infinite grossness&#8217; of this demand!
And how we relish his quiet laughter at Sir
Willoughby&#8217;s loathing of the &#8216;dust of the
world&#8217; touching the privileged object of his
choice. We conclude that Miss Durham
was a young person of spirit and sense when
she ran off with Captain Oxford, and heartily
wish her good luck upon her wedding-tour,
while Sir Willoughby abroad is holding an
&#8216;English review of his Maker&#8217;s grotesques.&#8217;
What a delightful stroke that is against the
British tourist! Thackeray never matched
it. If you would measure it fully, you have
but to stand apart and watch the faces and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
listen to the criticisms of our fellow-countrymen
abroad. Everything that is not British
is grotesque.</p>

<p>As the Creator is just as responsible for
foreign countries and foreign races as for
Great Britain, these criticisms, as Meredith
wittily points out, comprise a review of His
grotesques. It is in such light and inimitable
pen-strokes, to be found on every page, that
he shows us the man made bare to the very
heart. All his social virtues are ruthlessly
traced to the meanest source: his wish for
cloistral purity in woman, his regarding the
presence of competing admiration as a soil,
to its true Oriental origin, the monster
egoism of his prayer that even beyond
death his bride should be his alone, and
of his desire to shape her character to
the feminine of his own, without any
consideration for her natural and healthy
preference to be herself. All young men
who think it part of the poetry of love
to wish to see the unhappy maiden of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
choice reduced to ashes or incense, and
transmuted by love until they literally become
&#8216;the man they are to marry,&#8217; cannot
do better than study the Egoist, and see
for themselves the manner of man they are.
The study will fill them with a sense of
horror of themselves and of the accepted
notion of the infinity of love which Clara,
listening gravely, conceived as &#8216;a narrow
dwelling where a voice droned and ceased
not.&#8217; In her sharp apprenticeship as the
betrothed of this amiable young squire she
learned to become an attentive listener.
Little else was expected of her. But it was
the destiny of this intelligent and impulsive
girl to give Sir Willoughby many a rude
lesson in the sex she represented, that left
Constantia&#8217;s elopement and free talk of male
cousins and friends in the shade as minor
offences against taste and cloistral reserve.
After the preliminary descriptive pages, the
book is completely given up to Clara&#8217;s
struggle for freedom and her lover&#8217;s desperate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
efforts to retain her, fearful of ridicule
and the ignominy of a second jilting. She
rashly compromises herself with a brilliant
Irishman, while unconsciously her heart is
given to the Ph&#339;bus-Apollo turned fasting
friar to whom Sir Willoughby, meditating
revenge, intends to hand her over upon
granting her the freedom she claims, rejoicing
privately in the fact that his own
choice had irredeemably spotted her for
another. There is something pathetic in
the poor Egoist&#8217;s delusion, and while we
heartily despise him, we are against our
judgment forced to pity him when in the
strife his true character is exposed even to
his life-long silent worshipper, L&aelig;titia, and
we see the unhappy gentleman upon his
knees to that discarded devotee imploring
her to marry him, so that the county
should not say that he had been despised
and rejected by three women, one of them
poor and his inferior. His misfortune and
abasement are contemptible in their cause,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
and contemptibly borne, nevertheless the
something in us which responds to this
terrible monster within him begets the
pity of brotherhood. Degraded, shrunken,
stripped of the glory of success, we see in
him a monstrous image of ourselves, of all
mankind, so that we are afraid to turn from
him and wring hands with the wretch in
a kind of shamed sympathy. We readily
admit the pure comedy of this sublime
absurdity in human form reduced to such
shabby dimensions and exposed for the
ridicule of posterity, but we cannot laugh
very joyously at the exposure. There is
too much truth in it for the comic muse,
and the pathos is too apparent.</p>

<p>As Sir Willoughby is Meredith&#8217;s typical
analysis of the male&#8217;s character, so is Diana
Warwick his chief type of woman, and just
so ruthlessly as he is drawn is she drawn
mercifully&mdash;too mercifully, perhaps, for she
is painted in all the glowing colours of
love. Mr. Meredith is not the analyzer of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Diana; he is her ardent lover. He adores
her unscrutinizingly, as it behoves the true
lover to adore his lady. He paints her
very faults upon worshipping knees, and
does not think it necessary to apologize
for her or urge one word of excuse or deprecation
when, following fact, she stoops to
a shabby breach of confidence worthy the
lowest new journalist. She is Diana to
him in all her moods, a bewildering and
adorable creature, and as such he expects
the reader to swallow her thankfully, rejoicing
in her as he does, wondering at
the stupidity and evilness of the world
that condemns her, censuring the meanness
of the recreant lover who deserts her upon
discovery of her unexplainable betrayal of
his confidences. If his lady chooses to start
out at midnight, fresh from a love-scene in
which she has learnt from her lover a great
political secret, to sell it for a very substantial
sum to a London editor, Mr. Meredith
simply follows her as an admiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
recorder, and finds it sufficient explanation
to tell us pityingly that she was a child in
this world&#8217;s affairs, that she was as ignorant
as a child in business matters, and had no
idea of the gravity of her action. This last
plea we accept willingly, for impulsive women
like Diana rarely have any notion of the
weight of actions, and never can measure
their consequences; but for a simpleton in
worldly affairs she showed a pretty accurate
knowledge of the value of her secret and
of its market price, and for a lady to sell
secret information learnt in a love-scene
seems to us an unmistakable fall which,
however much we may deplore, we hold
ourselves exempt from admiring, or even
condoning, as Diana&#8217;s apologist desires us
to do.</p>

<p>As an Irishwoman I cannot but be
grateful to this big Saxon giant for his
generous advocacy of a famous country-woman
whom posterity persists in holding
spotted. He has taken her up in the teeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
of British opinion, and being deeply enamoured
of the splendid creature, he is not
satisfied in proceeding to whitewash her,
which would have been a simple enough
task, but he has clothed her in soft cloud
and fine radiance, he has all but sketched
her wings, and shown her standing tip-toe
on hard, solid earth with glance strained
ethereally upward. Not by any means an
angel, but a young goddess, half woman,
a creature of exquisite freshness, originality,
bewildering wit and soaring intellect, as
lovely as Aurora, and as cold, purer still,
and more remote from the contamination
of gross masculine admiration, than Diana.
Her mind flies upon barbed phrases. Her
commonest words take the shape of pointed,
illuminated arrows. She is the beautiful
Egeria of a young minister of state, the
immaterial soul of a polished old statesman,
by whom she almost loses her social head,
and is only saved from the block by the
stout defence of her devoted friends. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
is sunshine in a delicate and not happy
lady&#8217;s life, carrying a whiff of Irish mirth
and wit with her delightful presence into
the stately and decorous gloom of English
town and country existence, a mental draught
of champagne wherever she goes, all impulse
and brightness and warmth of heart. And
how this masterful knight of hers, turned
biographer, lashes those who were stupid
and wicked enough to misjudge her! For
every tear, every painful contraction of brow,
they forced her to in life, are they punished
by his unsparing pen. He uses it in her
defence like a true crusader&#8217;s sword. He
reviews her enemies in an almost passionate
anger, names them, notes every conventional
trick and fault, lays bare the tiniest spot
upon which to point his dreadful lamp of
ridicule, and then proceeds to shiver their
self-respect to atoms, to disperse their
highly-prized, respectable prejudices, and
leaves them divested of all but heavy
British stupidity, that prevents them from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
seizing the charm and comprehending the
personality of this brilliant young star shot
from the Sister Isle into their astonished
midst. Her freshness is the eternally vernal
freshness of the shamrock, her faults and
impulses the voice of a generous race seeking
expression through her ardent soul. He
makes her enemies his enemies. He wears
her colours nobly, gallantly, as behoves a
gentleman in whom the medi&aelig;val strain
still runs. He carries her gloriously through
the divorce courts, leaving her wooden Saxon
husband, of narrow, official soul, utterly
abased and shrunken, instead of triumphant
in her fall. We behold her after this crucial
ordeal clearer, whiter, more radiant than
ever; nearer to the immortal Diana she
images by reason of her new freedom;
clear-eyed as a maiden returned to the
forest-mists of unsullied imagination; and behind
her in the mire lies the crushed marital
form, unutterably mean and shabby and foolish
with his absurd &#8216;Yah, yah,&#8217; on his lips.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>In the case of her English husband and
her recreant English lover, her defender has
no worse fault to urge against them than the
stiff-necked prejudices of race. Both we see
like respectable carriage-horses in harnessed
strife with a young war-steed ready for
dangerous speed and nerve-upsetting tricks&mdash;a
potent, self-willed young creature,
sniffing menacingly at conventionality, audacious
from excess of purity, perilously poised
upon every incalculable impulse, and in spite
of a powerful intellect, scatter-brained upon
all the ugly brinks in her career. No
wonder the unhappy Saxon gentlemen allied
to this wild and too lovely Hibernian lost
their heads and turned tail when it came to a
choice of swallowing her whole and entire
and following meekly in her wake, the
obedient satellites Mr. Meredith thinks they
ought to have been, with heart filled with
gratitude, and eyes full of love and
admiration.</p>

<p>That they did not do so is their lasting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
shame and reproach, and he reviles them
as starched officials and stiff-necked Britons.
Whereas another and a less partial biographer
would mildly commend them to
our pity, because of their undeniable sufferings
at the expense of a female engine
that ran them down and left them in
fragments upon her path, he is only content
in piecing the fragments in order the more
powerfully to hold the feeble creatures up to
our ridicule. If it had not been for that fatal
newspaper episode, we should have been
more than disposed to share his ardent
sympathy, and range ourselves as warmly as
he upon his heroine&#8217;s side. But the newspaper
episode is an exceedingly big camel to
be asked to swallow without as much as a
wry face, above all to swallow and preserve
intact our ideal of a persecuted, disinterested,
and very noble woman. Though not the
most artificial of his books, the atmosphere
of &#8216;Diana&#8217; carries a heavier scent of the
midnight oil than even that garishly brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
study of a pair of tragic comedians. There
are dialogues in &#8216;Diana&#8217; that only stop
short of requiring a key&mdash;noticeably one
after-supper scene when the air is charged
with electricity, and wit oppressively polished
flies hither and thither, broken confusedly
upon rainbow sparkles of thought. Though
we are sick of commonplace chatter, the
intensity of self-consciousness and prolonged
mental effort involved in such a game of
battledore and shuttlecock, such a desperate
intellectual race for the prize for barbed
phrases and skilfully-managed metaphor, are
surely exhausting. Diana and her numerous
satellites seem never in the course of their
lives to have enjoyed five minutes&#8217; naturalness,
and never to have known the luxury of
mental dressing-gown and night-cap. Like
the sun, their intellects never sleep, know
not even the charm of drowsiness; and it is
frequently a strain upon lazy, easy-going
readers, used to Thackeray and Dickens, to
follow the unceasing play of intellectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
pyrotechnics. The most beautiful thing in
this remarkable book&mdash;next to Meredith&#8217;s
generous defence of his heroine,&mdash;the tenderest,
most naturally, humanly painted,
is the sweet and faithful friendship between
two intellectual women, one a soft-hearted,
delicate Englishwoman with the milder and
more clinging sentiments of her race, and the
other our vivid Diana, made up of Irish
cloud and Irish laughter, with her robuster
and more ardent temperament. This is a
fresh debt that women owe their mighty
champion&mdash;the recognition of their capabilities
for mutual friendship, faithful love
and generous admiration, which the cynical
male habitually denies them. Emma
Dunstane married, loves her bright Tony, as
she fondly calls Diana, above all the world;
and Tony, tossed upon a sea of amatory
difficulties, in turn beloved, rejected, and
divorced, faithfully loves her friend Emma
above even her faithless and her faithful
lovers, of which Heaven knows she has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
choice enough. One of them, Mr. Sullivan
Smith, is a sensational and finely-natured
Irishman, too apparently created after Lever
to be of value as a serious study.</p>

<p>The story is well known. A beautiful,
witty, young Irishwoman marries a wooden
English official of docketed opinions well
phrased. She is loved by many, notably
one other Englishman, Redworth, a fine
contrast with her husband, and Lord
Dannisburgh, whose admiration excites her
husband&#8217;s jealousy and leads to divorce.
Her faithful friends throughout are Lady
Dunstane and Redworth; afterwards Percy
Dacier, at first suspecting and coldly
scrutinizing, goes over to her and finally
succumbs. He is a stiff and starched young
Englishman, faultlessly correct and attractive
after his fashion, which is the reverse of a
warm one. Diana loves him, but there is
a sort of Diana mist thrown over her love,
which shows it as burning a cold clear light
like ineffectual sunbeams upon a glacier.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
The young minister of state and she are
engaged, and he returns late one night to
breathe a state secret into her ears. This
is the blot upon her character, the irretrievable
blot upon her life. When he has
kissed her for the first time&mdash;though no
word so barbaric and indelicate as &#8216;kiss&#8217;
has been written in the record by the writer,
fastidiously sensitive in preserving the snowy
plumage of his paragon&mdash;explaining that he
is but a mortal lover after all, she says the
fault was hers that she was degraded.
This is straining at gnats to swallow an
enormous camel. She goes forth from this
first embrace to sell his political news to a
leading editor. Fact or fiction, we cannot
get the unutterable ugliness of it out of our
minds. But whether Dacier was justified
in throwing her over for the action is for
male judges to say. Great and passionate
love, the sort of love such a woman should
excite, would, I imagine, have found a ready
road to pardon. Dacier is a cold-blooded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
politician, with whom we have not much
sympathy, and are not sorry to see him
degraded in his creator&#8217;s eyes, and, beside
his brilliant betrayer, shrunken to shabby
dimensions. He goes straight off&mdash;marries
a pious and virtuous young heiress, and
drops out of view. The stricken lady,
reduced to a state of suicidal prostration,
about whom the voices of rumour are for
a second time busily and unkindly engaged,
is not without her champions. Mr. Sullivan
Smith and Arthur Rhodes meet on their
way to propose for her, and eventually
her faithful lover, Redworth, wins what he
gallantly and manfully regards as a prize,
and thus the end is saved from tragedy.
We leave Tony too dazzled to know if her
views of life are brighter, and bearing love
for a dower to her husband. Only we continue
to wish she had not visited that
newspaper office.</p>

<p>Equally artificial and brilliant, and of a
fascinating brevity, is &#8216;Tragic Comedians.&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
Limelight plays blindingly upon the characters,
and Clotilda and Alvan seem to
flash before us like a couple of splendid
meteors, to faint and fade in their
own exhausted light. We blink and gaze
after them, thrilled, startled, and subdued
by their resplendency, with a keen sense of
the theatrical in their portraits and in their
actions. Garish the book is, but most vivid,
of a fascination not to be coldly analyzed,
of a charm indescribable. It is simply the
short story of the wooing of a royal lover,
of his lady&#8217;s betrayal of his love, and of her
marriage with his rival. Never was a wooing
like Alvan&#8217;s, never such a lover. That is
why we doubt the reality, and dream of the
footlights. We listen to him and read his
telegrams, and in spite of the Alpine sunlight
and the cool mountain air, we think of fireworks.
We read of Clotilda&#8217;s golden hair,
and we picture her flying through the clouds,
chased by her fellow-meteor and fronted by
the black night of marriage that extinguishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
her after his decent burial. Some of their
sayings seem written across the memory in
letters of dancing light, and we dream of the
scenes enacted by this pair of tragic comedians
long after we have left them. Of all
Mr. Meredith&#8217;s lovers, Alvan is the one who
fascinates and thrills us most.</p>

<p>Taking a general survey of his qualities,
we may note that Meredith the writer and
man is always more interesting than even
his best characters. It is how he develops
them, what he thinks of them, his inimitable
asides and epigrams, that we look for most.
In this he is not Shakespearian, for whereas
we get nothing of Shakespeare in any of his
plays, in all of his books do we get much
of Mr. Meredith. And in none of them too
much. The one in which he sinks himself
completely is, to my thinking, except as a
remarkable <i>tour de force</i>, the least interesting.
This is the &#8216;Shaving of Shagpat.&#8217;
George Eliot described it as pleasant light
reading. This reads like a joke, if so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
illustrious and serious a personage as George
Eliot could be deemed guilty of perpetrating
a joke so mild. The story and its abounding
verses are more Eastern than probably anything
in Oriental literature, and if we had
not &#8216;Vathek&#8217; as a precedent, we should be
disposed to regard the feat as an incredible
one. For after &#8216;The Shaving of Shagpat,&#8217;
&#8216;The Arabian Nights&#8217; reads as a model of
sober commonplace and the epitome of
everyday experience. Not only is the style
Oriental, but facts and colouring and atmosphere
are fabulously so. The impression
left upon the bewildered reader is that of a
kind of dazed passage beaten through a mass
of broken jewels in a soft artificial light,
richly perfumed with the heavy odours of
Eastern flowers and scents. Houris and
genii; roses, lilies, nightingales; diamonds,
opals, rubies, and sapphires; jets of flame
starting into illuminated fountains from the
heart of lilies set in opal lakes; winged
voyages through the pure Eastern air, over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
cities and plains and sunlit and moonlit landscape;
impassioned Oriental songs, gorgeous
metaphor richly massed through a wearisome
brilliance of colours and imagery; wild
amorous speech and tales, and descriptions
of feminine beauty to turn the head of a sage
and awaken a throb of envy in the breast of
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier. Conceive, in fact, every
strong imaginative effect heaped in reckless
profusion, till, from sheer fatigue of overwrought
senses, we hail with delight and
relief the seizure of the Identical, the final
triumph of the barber, and the shaving of
Shagpat. There are many beautiful passages
in it, and the humour of the parody is both
subtle and exquisite, but it is too luscious for
a single reading, though we may agree with
the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8216;Ripe with oft telling, and old is the tale,</div>
<div class="verse">But &#8217;tis of the sort that can never grow stale.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>This is Mr. Meredith, un-English and
impersonal, and he pleases us less. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
prefer his human comedy and his home
comic muse to this parody of distant literature.
We like best to feel his Saxon iron
grasp and his deep glance ransacking
humanity, as it lives and breathes, to its
uttermost depth, and twisting it to every
unimaginable revelation. We feel then in
the presence of our prose Browning, earnest
even in his laughter; Titanic, with an unsuspected
softness of heart beneath a rugged
and untender manner, and upon a homely
shaft of mother-wit ready to shade from us
the scientific penetration of his inward vision
of us. His wit is like a rainbow lighting up
a stormy sky, and his mocking carries no
baleful suggestion of a sneer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />


<small>GEORGE MEREDITH&#8217;S MEN AND WOMEN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> Shakespeare and Scott, Mr. Meredith
is uniformly gallant in his romances. With
the exception of Richard, his young heroes
are generally feeble youths; sometimes
pleasant and good-natured, like Harry Richmond
and Evan Harrington, and at others
bloodless, make-believe men like Wilfred
Pole and Percy Dacier. But all, as in the
case of Scott&#8217;s amiable young men and
Shakespeare&#8217;s lovers, are merely foils for
the greater worth of the heroines. Imogen,
Juliet, Beatrice, Miranda, the ladies of the
gentlemen of Verona, Portia, and Lady
Macbeth are all unworthily mated, and as
Mr. Ruskin has said of Scott&#8217;s heroes, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
are left wondering at the extreme and unmerited
good fortune of these various young
men who have drawn prizes, apparently as
rewards for their amiable and pleasing manners.
The fluted tenor of romance is on
the whole an ill-treated personage. We
invent him to do the love-making instead
of ourselves with the different ideals of
feminine perfection we imagine. But with
his qualifications, his serious merits, we are
not concerned. So long as he is handsome,
has the art of using his voice, his mouth,
and his eyes, carries his doublet and hose
gracefully, twangs the guitar of loverhood
musically, and recites his sonnets to advantage&mdash;behold
the virtues we demand of
him. He must be picturesque, above all,
and the bloom of youth must lie upon his
cheek, else as a sonneteer and troubadour is
he pronounced unserviceable by the orchestra.</p>

<p>Now, the heroine is quite another matter,
as Mr. Meredith, following great examples,
shows us. She must claim our sympathy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
our love, and our admiration. She must
be surpassingly fair, and no less lovely of
mind and soul. We are to quit her
enamoured and regretful, vividly aware of
her attractions, both mental and physical.
And this has Mr. Meredith achieved in the
case of all his heroines&mdash;maidens and
widows. They are beautiful, witty, pure,
womanly, and most captivating. Each one
holds us enslaved as we follow her
fortunes. She has but to open her lips,
and we are at her feet. In spite of
his harshnesses, Mr. Meredith remains
great by his generous sympathy with the
weak. In the strife between men and
women, a strife he never blinks away, or
feigns to discredit because his men choose
to fall in love with his women, he ranges
himself upon the side of women always and
inevitably&mdash;and what a defence in the ranks
of the enemy! He brings no drivelling,
one-sided sympathy to bear upon the subject,
but clear, logical sense and a keen eye for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
the weaknesses of the sex he defends. He
laughs at woman sometimes, and enjoys a
witticism and a taste of cruelty at her
expense. But he makes it understood that
his laughter is not scoffing and his cruelty
is not bitter. On the contrary, they but
add flavour to his championship, and make
us the prouder of the big blows he directs
against her tyrant. The tyranny of his own
sex he doubts as little as its selfishness,
which he has immortalized past cool endurance
for man in the person of Sir
Willoughby Patterne. The conventional
woman, all horrors and shivers at the aspect
of the natural and undecorated, made up
of drawing-room theories and lap-dog sentiments,
he rejects as unworthy of that which
he conceives woman might be, if relieved
from the sentimental trammels and restrictions
that the selfish grossness of man has
imposed upon her. He believes that women
would be all the better for living more as
men do, and men for meeting them half-way&mdash;one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
sex modified by the other, and
mutually ennobled; eating healthily in acknowledgment
of all healthy appetites, as
opposed to the coarse Byronic view that
condemns them to live upon air and the
sentiments. Sandra talks freely of potatoes,
fine ones too, while her sentimental lover
writhes and shivers, feeling pelted by those
potatoes, and the founts of love are nearly
dried at the root of his heart. Can a young
gentleman with a proper respect for himself
feel romantically disposed towards a young
woman, even if she be divinely beautiful,
when she owns to a capacity to dine off
potatoes? or ascend to heaven on an aria
when the prima-donna refreshes herself with
bottled stout? For such types, frequent
enough, he suggests that sunlight must be too
strong and gross, and wonders why they have
not set their wits to invent some soft extract
of a shadowy illumination wherewith to
diminish the terrors and uglinesses of mere
nature.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>He acknowledges the influence of woman
in no false, Frenchified way, but accepts it
as the strong ordeal and revelation of man.
&#8216;Women have us back to the conditions
of primitive man, or they shoot us higher
than the topmost star.... By their state
is our civilization judged; and if it is hugely
animal still, that is because primitive men
abound and will have their pasture.&#8217;</p>

<p>Of his men, it is the old and oldish
young that he draws best. His social
epigrammatists and his grave, elderly gentlemen,
or his caustic, elderly humorists, like
Sir Austin Feverel, the immortal wise youth
whose wit never goes to sleep, the gigantic
fraud, Richmond Roy, and his <i>fidus Achates</i>;
Tracy Runningbrook, Stukely Culbrett, Seymour
Austen, and a host of such others. We
must not forget Clara Middleton&#8217;s Irish
colonel, a very pleasant figure in &#8216;The
Egoist,&#8217; the German princess&#8217;s father and
Everard Romfrey. All these men have a
point in common. Their wits are keenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
alert, and they know not how to be dull.
They are also gentlemen. Not that all, or
many of Mr. Meredith&#8217;s male characters of
high social standing, can lay claim to this
qualification. There is in him, as in Thackeray,
a singularly strong flavour of democracy,
and a tendency to reveal us the snob concealed
by the varnish of breeding. The
young gentlemen in &#8216;Evan Harrington&#8217; are
the exact reverse of our ideal of the article.
Harry Jocelyn borrows money from the
tradesman he insults before repaying it;
gets money from him to give to a wretched
girl betrayed by him, and does not apply
it to the purpose for which it has been
given; conducts himself in all circumstances
as an offensive boor and an abject cur. The
young lords and squires around him do likewise.
Some of the gentlemen and peers
in &#8216;Richard Feverel&#8217; are very unpleasant
and shady company, and in &#8216;Rhoda Fleming,&#8217;
Mr. Algernon Blancove would find the
average clerk in the back streets of a manufacturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
town his superior in manners and
morals. We get some queer specimens of
upper-class snobocracy in &#8216;Harry Richmond,&#8217;
and what, pray, is Sir Willoughby
Patterne if he is not a wondrously decorative
and polished snob, contemplating complacently
his own superiority in the mirror of
his mind&#8217;s eye?</p>

<p>On the whole, Mr. Meredith is hard on
his own sex. Sometimes he draws a young
fool like Lord Palmet in &#8216;Beauchamp&#8217;s
Career,&#8217; who can be a lord, a fool, and a
gentleman at the same time; who makes us
laugh and holds our sympathies, there is something
so extremely natural in his idiocy and
something so very engaging in his candour;
and then we feel that the author is not hard
on him, and has no desire to excite our contempt.
But this tenderness to young men
of gentle birth is rare in Mr. Meredith&#8217;s
volumes. His laughter at them is not
usually soft-hearted, but grim, as in the case
of the youth who bought cigars to save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
himself from excesses in charity, and who,
after an ill-digested dinner and wine, sat so
long without moving a leg that he indulged
in the belief that he had reflected profoundly,
and woke up with the philosophic intent to
forget himself; being under some doom,
nobody caring for him, happiness unknown
to him, born under a bad star, and &#8216;following
his youthful wisdom, the wounded hart
dragged his slow limbs toward the halls of
brandy and song.&#8217;</p>

<p>As an apology for his somewhat merciless
dissection of fools like these young men,
Mr. Meredith adds:</p>

<p>&#8216;One learns to have compassion for fools,
by studying them; and the fool, though
nature is wise, is next door to nature. He
is naked in his simplicity; he can tell us
much, and suggest more. My excuse for
dwelling on him is that he holds the link
of my story. Where fools are numerous,
one of them must be prominent, now and
then, in a veracious narration. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
comes an hour when the veil drops on him,
he not being always clean to the discreeter
touch.&#8217;</p>

<p>And so he diligently leads us through the
unshadowy mental recesses of the fool in
question, as a sample of others abounding,
not compassionately by any means, with
perhaps too pointed a suggestion of sneer on
the tip of his caustic pen. He shows him
awaking to the conviction that England is no
place for him to dwell in&mdash;a conviction we
cordially share, with the consciousness that
England alone could have produced him&mdash;with
visions of himself married to a wife who
in the colonies would make butter or
cheese while he rode on horseback through
space; saw himself rejoicing her with a
declaration of love, astounding her with a
proposition of marriage, and in little more
than a week sailing on the high seas, newborn;
&#8216;nothing of civilization about him,
save a few last very first-rate cigars, which
he projected to smoke on the poop of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
vessel, and so dream of the world he left
behind.&#8217;</p>

<p>If this is compassionate treatment of the
fools, we wonder what Mr. Meredith would
be likely to regard as severe handling of the
genus. Indeed, Algernon Blancove, as the
typical brainless young English gentleman,
of no morals and less manners, runs in
several varied editions throughout the
author&#8217;s works. We come upon him under
different names, sometimes more of a boor,
as in the case of Harry Jocelyn; sometimes
more of a gentleman, as in the person of
Ferdinand Laxley, but ever drawn from the
same persistently objectionable type.</p>

<p>His older men, like Major Waring and
Seymour Austen, he touches with a truly
remarkable kindliness; a gentle sadness and
reasonableness pervade the atmosphere in
which he steeps their picture, and such is
their humane influence upon him, that he
drops, or nearly drops, metaphor, and adopts
the language of commonplace but cultivated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
humanity. If, as has been said by M.
Taine, George Sand makes us wish to be in
love and the English novelists aim to make
us wish to be married, Mr. Meredith may
be accused of a desire to prove to us that in
men middle-age is more attractive and lovable
than youth, and that the sedate sadness that
accompanies it but adds to the dignity of life,
its thoughtful measure never exceeding a
refined and placid geniality, and knowing no
other discord than a very mild sense of
disapprobation. In his men of this period,
and even beyond it, he indeed portrays us
thorough gentlemen, patient and honourable
men of dignified habits of life and of keenly
alert wits. Sometimes they have just a
flavour of fire and brimstone unconsumed in
an anterior stage, as in the case of
Beauchamp&#8217;s delightful uncle. He is a sort
of twelfth-century baron pleasantly masquerading
as a nineteenth-century country
gentleman, and more than one romantic
young person would be indisposed to hesitate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
upon the side of youth, if ordered to make her
choice between this elderly gentleman and
his fiery nephew. Nearly on the first page
he enchants us with the honest wholesomeness
and vigour of his talk, when, in reply to
something Beauchamp has said, he exclaims:</p>

<p>&#8216;Damned fine speech! Now you get out
of that trick of prize-orationing. I call it
snuffery, sir, it&#8217;s all to your own nose!
You&#8217;re talking to me, not to a gallery.
C&aelig;sar wraps his head in his robe; he gets
his dig in the ribs for all his attitudinizing.
It&#8217;s very well for a man to talk like that who
owns no more than his bare bodkin life.
Tall talk&#8217;s his jewellery; he must have his
dandification in bunkum. You ought to
know better. Property and titles are worth
having, whether you are worthy of them or a
disgrace to your class. The best way of
defending them is to keep a strong fist, and
take care you don&#8217;t draw your fore-foot back
more than enough.&#8217;</p>

<p>Such he walks the book, a stout and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
resolute old gentleman, with words of sense
upon his lips, capable of manly tenderness
and dignified concessions, and the embodiment
of all virile virtues as well as those
belonging to his class. While the charming
French girl and the sweet English maiden
hold our senses thrilled, it is this medi&aelig;val
baron that soundly raps our nodding judgment,
and keeps our wits awake.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as in the case of Edward
Blancove, Mr. Meredith wheels us round
from cold dislike into sympathy and
admiration. But not often. His unpleasant
young men are not more susceptible of
conversion than they are usually to be found
in real life, and he is not fond of playing such
tricks as this one, wherein we get from the
lips of a coldly argumentative and sharply
legal young gentleman, who has, hitherto,
conducted himself as something of a well-bred
knave, such honest words as these:</p>

<p>&#8216;Plainly, sir, in God&#8217;s name, hear me out.
She&#8217;s&mdash;what shall I call her? my mistress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
my sweetheart, if you like&mdash;let the name be
anything&mdash;&#8220;wife&#8221; it should have been and
shall be&mdash;I left her, and have left her, and
have not looked on her for many months. I
thought I was tired of her&mdash;I was under odd
influences&mdash;witchcraft, it seems. I could
believe in witchcraft now. Brutal selfishness
is the phrase for my conduct. I have found
out my villainy. I have not done a day&#8217;s sensible
work, nor had a single clear thought, since
I parted from her. She has had brain-fever.
She has been in the hospital. She is now
prostrate with misery. While she suffered,
I&mdash;I can&#8217;t look back on myself. If I had
to plead before you for more than manly
consideration, I could touch you. I am my
own master, and am ready to subsist by my
own efforts; there is no necessity for me to
do more than say I abide by the choice I
make, and my own actions. In deciding to
marry her, I do a good thing, I do a just
thing. I will prove to you that I have done
a wise thing.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Such words as these would redeem a
stormier and a shabbier youth than Edward
Blancove&#8217;s; they toss him up from the brink
of common rascality upon the verge of quiet
heroism. We are forced by them, not into
condonation only, but into respect and
admiring amazement, and we are almost
glad of a fault that has been so nobly
redeemed.</p>

<p>Apart from any other claim he may have
upon his generation, Mr. Meredith&#8217;s greatest
and most original will ever remain his marvellous
knowledge of woman. All young girls
upon the verge of womanhood should be
recommended an exhaustive study of him
upon this subject, as a healthy antidote against
the nauseous and abominable travesties of
themselves and their species circulated by
the libraries, in which volumes, however bad
the men may be drawn, the women are ten
times worse, fifty times more unnatural, and at
least a hundred times more corrupting to the
sane judgment. From him, instead of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
current inanities in which the typical heroine
of the circulating libraries is enveloped past
recognition of human sisterhood (thank
Heaven! for a fraternity with the monstrous
doll would be a greater grievance than any
we owe unkind nature), will they learn much
upon their sex that will give them material
for long and profound reflection. They will
learn that the eggshell appearance of woman
upon the boards of experience is a gross
exaction, the remnant of a grosser stage in
man&mdash;that the demand is the reverse of a
compliment to her. Instead of that ragged
aphorism (clothing of a lie), &#8216;that the hardest
on women are women themselves,&#8217; they
will be offered a higher and juster estimate
of their own natural mercy, and will hear
&#8216;that a woman in the pillory restores the
original bark of brotherhood to mankind,&#8217; a
remark to give them pause and set their
brains in another direction. They will also
learn, what they can never sufficiently appreciate,
that &#8216;what a woman thinks of women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
is the test of her nature;&#8217; that &#8216;in their
judgments upon women, men are females,
voices of the present sexual dilemma,&#8217; and
that in their desire to have a &#8216;a still woman
who can make a constant society of her pins
and needles,&#8217; &#8216;they create by stoppage a
volcano, and are amazed at its eruptiveness,&#8217;
and a word upon which we cannot too
insistently weigh, a gallant word from a male
pen, &#8216;that the motive life with women must
be in the head, equally with men.&#8217;</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
